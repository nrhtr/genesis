&gt; ./coldmud world &gt; log &amp;     did not stop the messages from coming
&gt; to my own terminal.  any ideas?

do:

  ./coldmud ./world &gt;&gt;&amp; logfile &amp;

&gt; Created new room $room3.
&gt; ERROR: $exit.spawn called with three arguments, requires one.
&gt; Thrown by interpreter opcode MESSAGE.
&gt; ~numargs in $nowhere.make_exit (defined on $room), line 8
&gt; ~methoderr in $programmer1.dig_to_cmd (defined on $builder), line 10

hee, this is because greg changed the way .init worked in world 4.0 from 3.0,
but he forgot to change it on exits.  Just change the init to be:

pass();
if (!inited) {
  &lt;what it sets&gt;
  inited = 1;
}

then:

;$exits.add_parameter('inited);

and it should work.

&gt; Also, the world-0.4 is pretty sparse, anyone got a decent DB built
&gt; that I can scarf up? I'm not in the mood to start from almost scratch
&gt; unless I have to.

Chaos will be releasing his core soon, and i'll be merging it into the Cold
Dark.  Other than that i'm not sure if anybody is working on anything...

&gt; I'm willing to create a manual for coding (since I'll be learning it at the
&gt; same time, should be a good beginner's intro by the time I get done.) so
&gt; I'm looking for as much solid stuff to build a good core as I can get.

Did you see Greg's Manual?
