&gt; 
&gt; Hey all:
&gt; 
&gt; Having convinced myself that I shoudl fold my own efforts back into 
&gt; the ColdCore mainstream, I went to set up the latest genesis and 
&gt; ColdCore.  Imagine my suprise when, according to the web page, I
&gt; found out that there is no ColdCore available for the latest genesis 
&gt; yet.
&gt; 
&gt; This is especially confusing as ColdDark claims to be running Genesis 
&gt; 3.0 and CDC 2.0.  Is this due to the text dump bug mentioned earlier? 
&gt;  If so, would it be worth releasing a tar of the 2.0 binary tree 
&gt; as a stop gap?  Or should I regress back to Genesis 2-10?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 

The textdump bugs are pretty trivial in 0.3-x. So trivial that I hadn't
even noticed them, TBH.

But 0-3.x has got some pretty severe changes from 0.2-x and it's not
something you should be using unless you're handy with a debugger, and
know how to find complex memory/disk/database/cache-handling bugs.

Realistically speaking, 0.3-x is not even in beta-test. It's still alpha
test, and prone to crash at any moment. Mostly old bugs that we are
tickling in new ways.
