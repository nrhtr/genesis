I have yet to really peer at the help system on coldmud lately... but
coolmud had a help system that was quite basic and handy
if you just did help by itself it echo'd a help file that wasn't in
the db... a kind of basic help &lt;actually... I model'd it after
the basic help screen you would get back on TinyMUD, that basicly
told you how to speak, describe yourself, whisper, page and a few
other really basic stuff...  when you  type help... if there was an arguement to help it checked to
see if a help file existed for that... and if not then it checked
objects in the room for help...
