as an aside, 6000 - 6xxx is used very rudely by x (i had a mud killed
once when i was silly enough to put it on 6000 and someone used x on
the console). unless your running a server on a host with more than
600 x instances, this prolly wont be an issue, but i thought i'd
mention it.

isnt 6667 the irc port?

I think standardized ports for inter ColdMUD stuff is a good idea, but
they can be pretty much arbitrary, right? It'd probably be better to
keep them in as tight a range as possible instead of scattered in the
66xx range, especially considering the equivalency extends up to above
99, as has been mentioned.
