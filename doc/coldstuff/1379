&gt; I'm willing to provide the Black Rabbit server as a "proof of concept"

&gt; machine.  If a sponsor for the site can be found, then that sponsor
&gt; should get the promotion from NBC Online.

I tend to agree with the others--they are asking for quite a bit as a
donation :)

However, I can provide ice.cold.org as a replacement for Black Rabbit when
the need arises, if no sponsor has come forward at that time (basically to
extend the proof of concept period).

We are working on a performance test of cold, using a robot Neale Pickett
has created which acts out a play, creating one connection per actor.  We
are going to setup several of these at various remote points around the
net, each in different rooms on the Cold server--testing performance at
each level of connectivity.  Unfortunately my 533mhz alpha is down for the
moment, so we will just be restricted to testing it on ice (120mhz cyrix
6x86 with 32mb ram).

&gt; Another concern is the use of the web.  I'm still not clear on this
&gt; requirement, but I know that they want to tie it in to their web page
&gt; some way.  If you look at the NBC web page, you will see that they make
&gt; heavy use of web technology, including lots of javascripts, and maybe
&gt; even java.  I don't really know what to do about this part.

It is very VERY easy to integrate things into the web from cold--and for
ColdCore there is already a very comprehensive, modular and easilly
extendable foundation for doing so.

&gt; So what do you think?  Is that a project worth doing and are there
&gt; enough resources in the Cold community to make it happen?  It's not a
&gt; great project if you want to run your own mud.  But it may enhance your
&gt; resume.

Never hurts to try :)
