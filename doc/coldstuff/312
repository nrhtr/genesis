&gt; P.S. I too have been having odd server problems, such as a blank startup
&gt; and crashing on textdump. I am even using 11.4, which has been modified
&gt; extensively. However, since the next release is already underway and will
&gt; be what amounts to an overhaul, I am not going to fuss over these problems.
&gt;
&gt; P.P.S. Note to individuals wanting to make their dbs compatible with future
&gt; releases: The following have changed for version 11.x

Actaully, a while back I converted tCD to 0.11.3 (BTW, when are we going to hit
1.0?), however it was rather buggy and wouldn't even start up for me.  Since I
couldn't track down SamIAm at the time, and I didn't have the time as it was, I
tossed the converted core and decided to stick with 0.10 for now (since most of
the changes take a few simple sed's and your done (God, I love regular
expressions now that I've taken the time to read about them 8).

&gt; traceback() returns a list of values instead of strings. It is of the form
&gt; [[~error, "msg (formerly returned by error_str()", arg (formerly returned by
&gt; error_arg())],
&gt; ['thrower ('opcode | 'method), opcode or method ('GET_OBJ_VAR, etc)],
&gt; (and the rest are the stack frames, as in [~error, 'method, #definer, #this,
&gt; line])]
&gt;
&gt; I believe the CD core parsed the old traceback() into this form. This will no
&gt; longer be necessary.

Luckily, since I pass all (most) tracebacks through that method it only takes
1 method change to implement this.

&gt; error_arg() and error_str() are contained in traceback() and have been
&gt; removed.

Something like traceback()[1][3] (arg) and traceback()[1][2] (str).

&gt; dict_add_elem() and dict_del_elem(0 have been removed. They may be coded in-db
&gt; with dict_add() and dict_del(), as well as a setadd() or setremove() and some
&gt; other logic.

setadd and setremove have been removed?  Quite frankly I never had the use for
dict_*_elem().

(don't even know why I'm commenting on this stuff).

(BTW, the new Enigma CD is great)
