This hit me last night.  Why hardcode which objects can call a builtin?  Rather
than doing that set it up so every builtin can be bound to an object.  Then
upon startup the first method bound is the one which binds the others, from
there all the "system" methods are bound to $sys (or whatever, perhaps
connection ones would be bound to a different one).  This would be much more
flexible and would allow for tight creation of in-db thunks (i.e. have a
$object.to_dbref() which would be a thunk for get_name() etc).  Anyhow.
