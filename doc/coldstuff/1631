&gt; So it will be in some part self regulating as far as load goes.  This
&gt; community server will become glacier.cold.org, and will require a
&gt; signed acceptable use policy (a variant of:
&gt; http://www.roguetrader.com/agreement.html)

It's moot, of course, but I wouldn't sign an agreement like that if my very 
life depended on it.

Some highlights are the instantly variable charges due and payable at the 
instant of consumption variability without notice; total disclaimer for 
fitness for purpose or merchantable quality;  the non-competition clause, and 
the several absolute discretions reserved by the vendor.

About the best thing you could say about the agreement is that most of it's 
probably unenforceable.

Colin.
