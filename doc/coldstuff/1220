	I'm a COLD-list lurker, who doesn't have quite the time to play with it as
much as I'd like.  I'm curious about your port though, because it would let
me (and others) setup a server on a non-unix box, which can be easier to
maintain sometimes.  My unix box is currently overloaded as is, and while
I've had cold up and running on it, I worry seriously about the resource
drain.
	I was wondering if it would be possible to get a copy of the win32 server
binary from you once it's complete.  

	Thanks!

(and I'd love to do testing, although I'm not sure what kind of a load I
can generate...)
