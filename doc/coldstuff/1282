Just to keep an eye on what is around:
Forwarded message:
&gt; From: Mark Waks &lt;justin@inmet.com&gt;
&gt; Subject: InterMOO: a high-power MOO server
&gt; Date: Tue, 22 Apr 1997 16:14:43 -0400
&gt; To: vworlds-biz@lists.best.com
&gt; 
&gt; This verges on advertisement, but since the subject of MOO Servers
&gt; came up:
&gt; 
&gt; Those who are interested in commercial-grade MOO environments should
&gt; give Intermetrics a call. For the past couple of years, we're been
&gt; working on InterMOO, a ground-up rewrite of the MOO server, designed
&gt; specifically for serious applications.
&gt; 
&gt; InterMOO is based on a real object-oriented database system, so it is
&gt; intrinsically persistent -- the bulk of the database is *not* kept in
&gt; core. This also helps it scale; since much of the database is on disk,
&gt; you don't need as much RAM and virtual memory as comparably-sized
&gt; traditional MOOs require. And although the system isn't currently
&gt; distributed, the distributed version is designed (it was part of the
&gt; plan from the beginning), and will be implemented soon. The server
&gt; currently runs on Solaris, with an NT port expected in the
&gt; not-too-distant future.
&gt; 
&gt; Reliability is already high, since the thing was carefully designed
&gt; from the start instead of just evolving, and is improving steadily as
&gt; we get some betas deployed and tested; performance already exceeds the
&gt; LambdaMOO server, and planned enhancements should boost it by another
&gt; 50% or so.
&gt; 
&gt; We have one reasonably substantial world running on InterMOO so far:
&gt; Wyndhaven, an educational MUD designed for elementary school kids. It
&gt; can be found at:
&gt; 
&gt; 	http://www.wyndhaven.com/
&gt; 
&gt; Wyndhaven is a WOO, and is primarily designed for use with a Web
&gt; Browser. It is specifically currently targeted for client PCs running
&gt; Netscape 3.0 and Java, with at least 800x600 resolution. (Macs will
&gt; usually run, but bugs in Java sometimes cause communication problems;
&gt; Internet Explorer can run with Wyndhaven, but requires a stripped-down
&gt; client; lower resolution screens will work fine, but the graphics will
&gt; be clipped a bit.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Wyndhaven is highly multimedia, so it's not lightning-fast over a 28.8
&gt; connection; it's designed to use some clever tricks, so that the
&gt; multimedia content can be optionally distributed on CD-ROM or in local
&gt; uploaded files, which are automatically detected and used if present.
&gt; And some of the fancier rooms require particular plugins (eg, Shockwave).
&gt; 
&gt; Wyndhaven is based on a highly extended JHCore; we're in the process
&gt; of writing a very lean, high-performance core from scratch, to get the
&gt; kind of speed a commercial multimedia system wants.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone's interested in more information, please write to me and I'll
&gt; send it along, or put you in touch with the appropriate folks. (I'm not
&gt; much involved with the server per se; I've mainly been doing the server/
&gt; browser architecture.) We're definitely looking for more serious
&gt; commercial applications, particularly for multimedia and multimodal
&gt; virtual world apps, and applications that stretch the boundaries of
&gt; what you can do with the MOO environment...

&gt; Random Quote du Jour:
&gt; 
&gt; "The phased approach to implementation could be described in the following
&gt;  manner:
&gt;     1. Design, code, and test each module by itself (this is commonly known
&gt;        as unit test).
&gt;     2. Throw all the modules into a large bag.
&gt;     3. Shake the bag very hard (this is commonly known as systems
&gt;        integration and test).
&gt;     4. Cross your fingers and hope that it all works (this is commonly known
&gt;        as field test)."
