&gt; Imagine if, each time you wanted to do something, you had to stop and
&gt; remember which 4-tuple of quoting semantics the command you're
&gt; thinking of uses.  Staggering.

No, no, no, no, no.  I have never had someone miss my point so completely (and
trust me, Lynx does a lot of it).  I had thought it would be fairly obvious
from everything else I said that this is exactly what I was NOT proposing.
There are two issues here.  One is how user commands should be handled and the
other is how match_template should work.  they are related but they are not the
same.

The command parser would only use one specific set of options for matching all
command templates, but which options are used would be up to the people writing
the DB, not hardcoded into the routine.  In short, make the server as flexible
as possible and leave the actual uses of it up to the people designing the
individual systems.
