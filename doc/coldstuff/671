I wrote:
&gt;&gt; := is what is used in Pascal, and it is mistaken by = no less. People fail
&gt;&gt; to type the : too easily.
&gt;&gt; In other words, it might not solve the issue.
&gt;&gt; I think &lt;- is very good, and that its being 'far from normalness' can be an
&gt;&gt; asset, since the 'normal' methods cause confusion.

Jeff Kesselman answered:
&gt;Well, I'm going to be the dissenting voice here.  +=, -=, etc. all seemed
&gt;very rational to me.  The = being an assignment operator ONLY caused me
&gt;some trouble when i forst moved from Pascal to C, and it was minor
&gt;trouble at that.  You learn very quickly to be careful abotu this.  The
&gt;(IMO sad) fact of the matter is that fewer and fewer students are even
&gt;taught Pascal before C, so I REALLY think diverging away from C syntax
&gt;just because of some misguided notion that "we can do it better" is a BAD
&gt;idea.  Currently, the places ColdC differs from C for the most part make
&gt;logical functional sense. (Such as in the for construct, which is a true
&gt;set operator rather then a simple ordinal iterator.)
&gt;
&gt;The fact of the matter IMO is that divergence
&gt;away from C, even in an attempt to "make it clearer" will onyl make it
&gt;harder for people to learn the language.
&gt;
&gt;My 2 cents.


OK, let me clarify my statement/opinion:
I think that just '=' as assignment operator is ok. That the programmer
should learn to pay attention to the difference with '=='.
What I was saying is that, if the notion is to drop '=' because it may
cause confusion, then ':=' isn't any better. At that, '&lt;-' may be stronger.
