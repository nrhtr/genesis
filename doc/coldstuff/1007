Since patching the server to p6, I've been getting fairly frequent
crashes.
I've got minimal postmortem info, but it seems that strdup() is being
passed a NULL pointer fairly often. Anyone else getting this?


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I traced a bit through the program. I discovered the following:
&gt; 
&gt; First, my telnet sends ^C in character mode instead of the line mode, so
&gt; ^C sequence it interpreted immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, connection_read got only garbage from the connection (the
&gt; sequence it actually read was 6, 255, 254, 255, 253, 6). This could be a
&gt; telnet bug.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, this is the only situation when core gets a line that is not
&gt; terminated by CR/LF. I'm not sure this has been tested in any way.
&gt; 
&gt; Fourth, `[65,10,3].to_strings() =&gt; ["a",`[3]]
&gt; (can we handle buffers in these lists? Especially if it terminates by a
&gt; buffer?)
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, when I kill my telnet, I get neatly disconnected, and my
&gt; connection object destroyed. So I don't think that is the problem.
