This is an informational notice which is being sent out to anyone from whom 
I have received mail from at my netcom address who may not be aware of my 
change of address, and to some maillists to which I have posted frequently 
from my old address.  I've attempted to trim the list down and screen out 
duplication as much as possible without leaving anyone important out.  
Apologies for any duplication or unwanted mail, I'll try to keep this short.

My email address, FTP directory, and related documents and information are 
moving.  After suffering through many months of incompetence and shabby 
performance from netcom of a level that would be disgraceful even from a free 
service, let alone one which I'm actually paying a decent amount for, it has 
reached a point where, tedious though the process is, I have decided to change 
to another service rather than endure this any longer.  (those wishing a more 
detailed diatribe on why nobody should ever even think about doing business 
with netcom can mail me at my CRL address and I'll be happy to expound on this 
subject)  This message is one of the final steps in this process.

From now on, please note the following new addresses for myself and my related 
files:

Email address:     riche@crl.com
WWW Page:          ftp://ftp.crl.com/users/ro/riche/html/riche.html
FTP directory:     ftp.crl.com /users/ro/riche
MOO Patch Archive: ftp.crl.com /users/ro/riche/MOO_patches

Please note particularly, anyone with WWW links to my home page should make a 
point of converting all references of
  ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/stewarta/html/stewarta.html
to
  ftp://ftp.crl.com/users/ro/riche/html/riche.html

..as the old netcom URL will soon become obsolete and cease to function.

Again, apologies for any unwanted mail.  This will be the only notice I send 
out regarding this change.

-R
