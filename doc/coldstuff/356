I thought the question was why output which was echo()ed before the call to
 text_dump() was seen after the dump had lagged things.

So is the actual question how to get around this problem with a db code change
 or how to get around this with a server change?

I would answer the first with the following: Have a warn_time param on $sys,
 and when you reach warn_time seconds before the usual backup time, make the
 announcement. As long as warn_time is at least 1 you will see the output
 in time (assuming my as yet untested theory is correct).

My answer to the second would be to find out what dispatches waiting outbound
 net IO, and call it inside of the server text_dump() routine before starting
 the dump.

I would vote for an in-db solution so as not to risk introducing a server bug.

Crag,
wondering if he's even close to what was asked...
