&gt; I like '&lt;-', but it really doesn't imply expression anymore than
&gt;  an equals sign does.  I'd suggest '&lt;&gt;', since its easy to type
&gt;  and kind of implies "we are not both equal and we want the whole
&gt;  world to know it, that is why we are pointing outward."

But assignment really isn't symmetric.  There's a deep difference 
between lvalues (the stuff on the left hand side) and rvalues (the 
stuff on the right hand side).

&gt; As for the local method character, instinctively I like ',' since
&gt; it's a less emphatic period.  

Been using @d lately? :-)

&gt; But I don't know the repercussions of using a comma in such a way.

My brain's too fried to figure out if this language is in LALR(1), I 
had a midterm on code generation today, we already had our test on 
parsers, I shouldn't have to know this any more etc etc etc.

Anyway, I really wish you wouldn't use , for this.  I read , as a 
separator.  Actually, I don't like .foo much as a call-on-self 
syntax, because it's too easy for my eyes to skip over that little 
one-pixel dot, since . isn't a separator in that case either. 

&gt; blah blah blah

Yeah.
