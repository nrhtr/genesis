&gt; Hey greg, I have a question, howcome after everybody convinced me to
&gt; change $user to $person in this heirarchy, you made the core as
&gt; $user?  :)

I think you're confused.  What people didn't want to see was $player
representing all user connections.  I still have $person, which is an
ancestor of all objects modeling people (perhaps not user-controlled
people).

coldstuff probably isn't the best forum for minor details of core
design; we have quite a few subscribers now, and there are a lot of
nitty details.  Feel free to send me mail personally about small
issues, and mail to the list about things which are likely to concern
many people (conceptual issues, announcements, etc.).

As for bugs, the best thing for me is not a gdb stack trace of a core
dump (although it helps), but a reliable procedure for repeating the
bug.  Again, these should probably go to me personally.
