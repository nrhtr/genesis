I'm trying to figure out what this is, and it just hit me what it MAY be, but
i'm not sure.  Basically every so often the server will simply crash on a
textdump (logfile):

Sat Apr  2 19:30:24 1994: PANIC: Cannot remove file 'clean'.
Sat Apr  2 19:30:24 1994: RECURSIVE PANIC: Cannot remove file 'clean'.

Now, the server is on a hard NFS mount, however with our network being
overhauled the NFS link has become so damn bad that you get NFS pauses about
once every 5 minutes (pauses being more than a slight thing, in that it sends
you NFS server not responding...NFS server ok, etc).  The pauses are usually
only 30 seconds to a minute, but they can be longer.  Would this cause a
problem with coldmud?  Could it just get frustrated trying to access files
on disk, through the NFS pauses, and just crash when the NFS server doesnt
respond in time?  I know this is reaching but I cannot find any other reason,
as there are 93 megs currently on the disk...
