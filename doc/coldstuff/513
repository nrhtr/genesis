Well, I've pretty much finished up the GET method for the web server at
tCD.  I even created a few 'scripts' in /bin (you can do /bin/show?object,
/bin/list_method?$object.method(), and /bin/who).  However, if you want
to get a more 'html' version of an object use /objects/object (screw the
.html extension, the $reference is optional).  Connecting
with a simple slash (/) will give you the motd.  The http daemon is listening
on port 8080.

Example object requests:

http://recumbent.declab.usu.edu:8080/objects/root/

http://recumbent.declab.usu.edu:8080/bin/list_method?$root.initialize()

etc.

I just wrote this all in the past few hours, so don't be too disappointed
if something doesn't work. PLEASE do tell me if something doesn't work.  It
is using the new network system at the Cold Dark 
($network/$daemon/$connecton/$connection_interface and others).

And, if you are even more bored, telnet to port 4444, I have the finger
daemon running on it again (works like GNU finger).
