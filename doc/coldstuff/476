&gt; exactly what *is* the status of all the cold sites? How many are there?

I dunno.. tCD isn't (officially) up at the moment but will be as soon as I get
moving DU to its new site and getting a secondary developental MOO up out of
the way. (yeah, yeah, I know I've been saying that for a while now.. it's
getting there slowly, tho)

&gt; is there any unified effort to make a reasonable core?

As brandon mentioned, he's finishing up a basic core.. once tCD gets back up
again most of the effort there will go toward developing better cores as well,
I suspect.  Part of the reason I'm trying to bring DU and tCD together somewhat
is to work on paving the way for future expansion of DU into a ColdMUD base,
which will require a good core first.  I'm hoping I can get some of the people
from DU to get interested in ColdMUD too.

&gt; What is the status of the various hacked version of the server?  What's
&gt; the latest on the suspend()/fork() issue?  How thoroughly tested are 
&gt; those?

Well, as best I can tell nobody's really working on the server at the moment..
I've been thinking of offering to take on the mantle of official server
maintainer since nobody seems to currently have it..  If someone else has a
problem with this let me know, otherwise I suppose people might as well start
sending their problems/bitches to me.  I'm gonna try to start working on some
of this stuff within the next week or so anyway, and I'm gonna go looking back
through this list to see what kind of stuff needs to be worked on server-wise.
