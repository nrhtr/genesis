Are you spelling it like "north east" or "south west"?
I just added two exits to room on my place, one leading north and the other
leading northeast. I'd suggest ya look on the helpfile for name templates.
It explains how to have an exit with two names, like having "northeast" and
"ne" target the same $path thingie. I'm no pro, but that's my two yen. I
found the quickest way to get an area built is using the @dig command as
thus:

@dig north;south to a vast library

The first direction is the exit from the current place, the one after the
semicolon is the exit from the attached place. Pretty simple, eh? Then all
ya gotta do is describe the room ya just built and perhaps the $path, if you
do that sort o' thing.

It's okay being a newbie, these fellows don't bite much I've found. As many
would attest, I've had my share of REALLY asinine questions and I have no
scars to show for it. Quick praise unto all who have helped me thus far,
you've all been great!

Subject: Quick Question


&gt;        I am trying to make a room that would incorporate all directions
into
&gt; it (NE, NW, SE, SW, S, N, E, W) but it's not allowing more than one
instance
&gt; of North or South in a room is there way to get around this and if there
is,
&gt; and if there is may i ask how ?  Before you ask....Yep I'm a Newbie.
