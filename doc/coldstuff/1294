&gt; What do I need to do to make $player work right?  Same
&gt; would be true for $storyteller.  I realize that these objects
&gt; may not be complete, but since they inherent $user they should
&gt; be okay to play with.  Am I wrong?

Its my mistake, just do:

    @chmod +command_cache $player $storyteller

Also, a safe place to put things in the heirarchy is to insert $player
after $user and before $builder, and to put $storyteller after $builder
and before $admin.

If you want notes on the rule system I was starting to create, contact me.
Its one I've been developing for about 8 years now.
