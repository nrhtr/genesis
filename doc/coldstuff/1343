You familiar with how well oil and water mix?

Its close to that.. muse, mush and mux are so totally different from cold in their programming its not even funny.

There are a few similarities.. in that every online multi user system is going to have the same basic concepts:

various permission levels: user, builder, programmer, administrator
rooms and exits and messages when moving around between them
some systems, including cold has realms or zones

But there are some signifigant differences between how the above features are implemented and how they're used.

If you want an easy transition, you probably won't find it.  If you want a far more powerful system that you can customize to your hearts content with more degree than you ever thought possible with muse/mush/mux, you're all set.

I'm a programmer at heart.. so I like coldc a lot.. its very C like, its very easy.  The functional language in muse/mush/mux gives me heartburn.  Its extremely difficult to code anything even remotely complex in that 'language'.

Well.. I better stop before I start to seriously rant about how much I learned to hate muse and mush (never actually used mux, but its mush at heart).

Later,
Brad
