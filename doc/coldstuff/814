Right now the driver cannot do this.  The database does it by setting a
a root variable each time you change the name.  The reason the driver cannot
do this is because it only keeps track of it from the $name-&gt;#xxx angle.
We _could_ add another table, but this would get crufty and wouldn't be
too useful.  However, it would be a very nice thing to let the driver
do #xxx -&gt; $name lookups.  I've been considering having a 'known' variable
that it looks for on root, but this gets really ugly, like MOO.  However,
what if we were to do this, but have the known variable be set online,
with the default being no variable (and no #xxx-&gt;$name lookups).  Then,
the db could perhaps call set_objname_lookup('objname), to set it to
lookup on 'objname variable defined on root, or set_objname_lookup(0), which
would shut it off...

Does this repulse/appeal to anybody?  This would definitely simplify a
lot of things...
