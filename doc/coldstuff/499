Pardon another question folks, but I'm having trouble figuring something 
out from the Coldstuff manual.

Its kind of a two part question:
	1) When object-variables are inherited, does the inheritor
           have its own copy or do all inheritors reference the
           parent's copy?
        2) I can see a need for both. In some cases you want
           a variable to act like a c++ static member,
           at other times you DEFINATELY need your own
           copy. (For instance, I have a window-object that
           is defined once but I want independant copies
           for each oen tahts opened.) How is this handled?
           Is this what frobs are for?

Thanks
