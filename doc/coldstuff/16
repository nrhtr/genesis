&gt; I'd like to hear why my code wouldn't work.  Keep in mind that nothing
&gt; keeps track of connection objects except for $sys, which starts off
&gt; with a clean slate.

I cannot recall (shoulda saved a log file).  It just printed some errors
dealing with ~type to the logfile and didnt destroy anything...

&gt; If you put it in the wrong place, yes.  The code should be placed near
&gt; the beginning of $sys.startup().

sure, now you say that :)  Althought in retrospect it does make sense.

&gt; This is *not* the right way to do it.  It will leave one connection
&gt; object, but there is no guarantee that it is the particular one that
&gt; the system object has as the receiver on the port.  You got lucky.

Well, I said that there was probably a better way to do it.  And I am lucky.
