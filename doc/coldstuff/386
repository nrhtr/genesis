The most recent post to this list about a problem on an HP/UX 9000 machine
 brought up a question in my mind, since I had never seen the problem as
 describe and had made coldmud on various machines.

What machines has ColdMUD been successfully built on? I can attest to
 SunOS 4.1.3 and Linux 1.0.8, but I was unable to compile under IRIX 4.3.
 The IRIX problem might have to do with an old gcc (2.5.5 as opposed to 2.5.8)
 but the error itself looked too strange. Had to do with a temporary file
 being 0 bytes instead of 96. I have put out feelers looking for help on this,
 but have not gotten much in the way fo replies.

Anyway, what other machines have people tried and succeeded or failed?
