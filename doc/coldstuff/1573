How do people usually set up editing when they're doing a lot of
programming?  In Genesis, or other MOOs, doesn't matter.  I'm just looking
for good concepts.  I'm ready to start implementing editing in my core.

The line-based editor in ColdCore is sort of workable, but also eminently
unusable for large editing projects.

Right at the moment I'm writing everything in Emacs and recompiling and
restarting after each change, which is hardly optimal.  I didn't have a
working user interface before this, though, so it was the only option.  :)

I've heard of various TF macros and Emacs modes, but I'm not sure how to
set these up.

It would work for me to be able to tell the game to read in and compile
methods from a given file, but that depends on filesystem access to the
machine where the server is.  Which is fine while I'm running it on my
machine, not so fine when it's sitting on a server somewhere.  :)

Anyway, just looking for ideas... let me know how editing is implemented
in your game, or how you think it should be implemented.  All the code I
write will be freely available, so I don't mind giving it back if you want
me to write the code for your idea -- as long as it works for me too.  ;)

Thanks,
