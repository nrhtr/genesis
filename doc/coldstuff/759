&gt; Actually, we could just not allow intrusive file openings like with

Might work.

&gt; &lt; Hm.  The answer is: neither.  Files are more complex than net 
&gt; &lt; connections, you'd want to be able to seek around in them and the like.  
&gt; 
&gt; But do you really?  I can see file read/write being used somewhat, but
&gt; file seeking and other higher level ops just wouldn't.  Cold is a higher
&gt; level language.  I feel that type of control is beyond it's intended
&gt; scope...

I do really.  Yes, Cold is high-level, but any language that deals 
directly with files AT ALL will want to do seeking.  Imagine dealing with 
big Acrobat files without seeks ...

Files without seeking are like ... like tape drives or something.  Ew.
