I did rewrite the parser from scratch, but ONLY as a temporary quick 
'hack' until we can get a 'real' parser in yacc.  As my experience with 
yacc is restricted I opted for the quicker less forgiving path of doing 
it by hand.

To address your various concerns:

   * multiple lines were _not_ allowed in variable declarations before, if
     they existed, the value on another line was simply discarded (i.e. it
     wouldn't say anything).
   * multiple lines ARE allowed, you simply need to escape them with a
     backslash.  At the time this seemed like a perfectly logical idea.
     However, I've since realized it isn't, as then an inconsistency exists
     compared to variables.
   * 0.3 isn't meant as a stable release, it is still a beta.  Stick with
     0.2-x if you want stability.
   * I'm willing to take parsers from generous programmers :)

(BTW, the &lt;space&gt;// is a bug, and should not happen, same with the x=x)
