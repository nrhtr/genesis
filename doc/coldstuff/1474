Lately I've been adding and removing a lot of monitoring messaging to =
coldcore systems (CML compiler, setting system) at Aeternity so that I =
could easily see how they work.  The thought occured to me that a =
monitoring system might be helpful to others coming behind me that would =
likely wind up doing the same thing.  Before I go any further, let me =
ask if there is currently any monitoring system in place that I simply =
haven't discovered?

If the answer to that is no, does anyone have suggestions as to what the =
best concept for a monitoring system would be?  I was thinking of using =
@set to allow users to hook themselves into an event for the specific =
system.  The system itself would then need to be modified to send the =
appropriate messaging to users hooked to the event.  Would such a =
monitoring system be a major performance impactor?  If this isn't =
acceptable, what about simply sending .announce() calls from different =
systems to a monitoring $place?
