&gt; I finally decided to start playing around with my external bots again.
&gt; The C language version is a chopped up version of Mauldin's Colins and I
&gt; had to noop all the prefix/suffix stuff so that the bot could operate on
&gt; the Cold world.  The purpose of the prefix/suffix stuff is to say "I'm
&gt; done" when certain time-consuming commands are done.

I also believe the mass-neotek stuff used that to help prevent people
from spoofing the bot.  It would be able to tell what output was from
what it was doing or something like that.  Back in the old days there
were times when Julia was abused many times by things like that.

 
&gt; I can play around without the prefix/suffix feature, but I don't think I
&gt; can get full use of the bots without the feature.  I believe that
&gt; Brandon sometime ago mentioned that I could use VEIL to do the same
&gt; thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there an easy way to add the prefix/suffix or to at least fake it?

I'd think it wouldn't be too hard at all.  All you have to do is add
something into the command parser that echos stuff out before a command
is executed and after.

Peace,
