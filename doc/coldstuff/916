&gt; It just occured to me that most of the checkpointing time is wasted on
&gt; cp - the database has to be copied clean. I thought of a way to keep the
&gt; database clean 95% of the time. This would also make the server a lot safer.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing that would have to be modified is the cache handling. I suggest
&gt; that modified objects could be kept in RAM till the next checkpoint, and
&gt; the checkpoint would be when a) 30 minutes (or whatever) passes, or b)
&gt; more than 75% of the cached objects are modified. Then we could dump
&gt; just the modified objects, and the database would be non-clean only during
&gt; the dump, the cp being unnecessary.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you all think about this?

This sounds good, but how much RAM would this eat up?  Would it inflate 
dramaticly or unnoticably?  On a busy coldmud, I'd assume that if you 
have a lot of object creation, you'd have more frequent checkpointing.  
Though, that's just how it seems to me...
