I sent the following as a reply to the faq and it bounced back with a
 connectino timeout so I'm sending it here in hopes that the maintainer
 of the FAQ will get the info eventually anyway and update it.

&gt; Here are some corrections to the FAQ:
&gt; 
&gt; In the present state of cold section when it talks about private methods,
&gt;  ".foo();" should be ":foo();".
&gt; 
&gt; Jordan Baker has bowed out of Cold development indefintely. His band got
&gt;  some time in the studio and is recording or something. Neither he nor
&gt;  I are working on Cold in any way.
&gt; 
&gt; Frozzen Apples is no long up nor available. You are better of with one
&gt;  of the other cores anyway, since FA has so many loose ends.
&gt; 
&gt; As previously annouced, I am now working on programing for my actual job
&gt;  and am not doing anything with cold other than commenting on the list. I
&gt;  will return to cold development if I get some time and nothing better comes
&gt;  along in the interpreted oodb with net connections world, and I don't do
&gt;  something on my own.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for maintaining the FAQ. It looks good.
