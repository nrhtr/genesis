&gt; I also believe the mass-neotek stuff used that to help prevent people
&gt; from spoofing the bot.  It would be able to tell what output was from
&gt; what it was doing or something like that.  Back in the old days there
&gt; were times when Julia was abused many times by things like that.

Poor Julia and friends were the objects of much abuse.

Colin needs a lot of rework to make it Cold-friendly; 
I think it would be easier to build a new one base on Joe Strout's 
Python agent.  The main reason why I use Colin is because I'm actually 
playing around with some C lib stuff
and I can quickly interface an external bot to the lib and then play 
with it interactively.  It's not necessarily the best, but it works--
sorta.
