At risk of continuing a debate that aught to die real dead, can I make 
just a few comments?

All IMO:

Brandon, by virtue of being active, helpful to newbies, and maintaining a 
coherent ftp site deserves some special consideration.  Not that I am 
sugegsting that he is 'God of Coldmud' a someone sugegsted, but I think 
he's earned a little respect.  Anyone else honestly interested in doing 
the same can earn the same respect.

Alex has generously volunteered his efforts to coordinate the 
development.  Its a dirty, thankless, pain-in-the-ass job and I for one 
am greatful he's willing to do it.  Again, that earns a little respect in 
my eyes.  Its a very productive and positive activity.  If someone else 
really wants this job then speak up, and we can always put it to 
some-kind of vote.

I think i agree with Brandon that some rules re a good thing, for 
communication if nothing else.  They don't have to get over-encumbering.  
IMO Brandon's sugegsted list isnt.  Ultimately, though,as the man who has 
to do the coordinating, Alex should at least get to make some final yay 
or nay recommendations.

Anyone who is unhapy with grou pdirecton can always go out on their own.  
last time I looked coldmud source was still freely redistributable.

Having said all this, i think politics is a damn waste of time and 
flame-wars are an even bigger nuiscence.  Can we get back to the business 
of making this server something that'll kick LM's butt?

Thanks
