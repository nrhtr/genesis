I was going to remark on this:

&gt; Consistency is required for a decent user interface, and simply saying
&gt; "they'll figure it out" is not good enough because they shouldn't have
&gt; to if it's properly done in the first place.

I was going to say something about how slavish devotion to consistency
can get you in trouble, but then I decided it was moot when I read
this:

&gt; match_template(template, string, quote-char, quote-handling, field-handling)
&gt; 
&gt; where quote-char is a single-char string (specifying which char
&gt; should be used in the place " is used currently) or a double-char
&gt; string (specifying an open-close pair), quote-handling is a symbol
&gt; specifying whether quotes are transparent (removed from output),
&gt; passed thru intact, etc. and field-handling specifies whether quotes
&gt; denote field breaks and whether quoted portions can match keywords
&gt; as well as wildcards, etc.

Wow.  I can't even think of anything to say.

Imagine if, each time you wanted to do something, you had to stop and
remember which 4-tuple of quoting semantics the command you're
thinking of uses.  Staggering.
