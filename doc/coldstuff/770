869683 Gillespie Brandon James drew these hieroglyphs:
&gt; 
&gt; I've been toying with the implementation of fork(), and Jeff brought up that
&gt; it may be better to implement something slightly different, such as:
&gt; 
&gt;     send(object, 'method, [args])
&gt; 
&gt; Which would be virtually the same as object.method(args), except for that
&gt; it "forks" off.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have comments on this, compared to a direct fork() implementation?

my vote is for a direct fork implementation.  send() just doesn't hint
at forking.  if you want to get LPmuddish (you may stop laughing now),
you could call it call_out(), but fork is so much more versatile, and
lets you fork off a whole block of code instead of a single method
call.

However, they're actually semi-different concepts anyway.  fork() has
to copy the execution environment, whereas send() wouldn't have to.
So send() would be a lot "cleaner" than using an explicit fork.  Am I
far off the mark here?

Anyway, I suggest two things if you do create it:

1. Call it something different.  send() just doesn't say 'fork'.

2. An argument for a delay time ala fork (n)
