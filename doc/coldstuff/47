I'm probably just stating the obvious here...

I'm sure this isn't a new idea, but I see no reason all NPC's couldn't be
controlled by one off-db program (if you have an extra computer). Have 
someone's program log in as 'GameMaster',
and have the GM control its charachters as puppets.

This would have the advantages of a client robot, while only requiring one
extra computer for several (50? 100?) robots. I don't know how much load this
would put on the server, communication wise, but I bet it could be optimized to
be far less then an equal number of single-robot programs or actual players.

Just think, MOO's and MUDs are multi-threaded, and they don't even know it...
