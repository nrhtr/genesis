I've had a lot of fun playing with ColdMUD at the COld Dark and MonoHaze, but
these sites are often down for upgrades and the like. I would like to have a
copy I could run locally, but I don't have a unix machine. Has anyone done any
such porting as adventurous as to a DOS type machine? Am I sane? Can it be
done? Should I just get something that can run linux and run it on that? If I
do port to OS/2, does anyone have any advice?
