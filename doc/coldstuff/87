Ok, right now the server simply ignores any ansi/unreadable code (ie doesnt
save it in any text or anything).  I can see the viewpoint that it breaks
clients, but I still think that it should at least be there.  This is because
you may want to have a 'graphics' type mode, which can return colored text, and
various other fun things.  YES you can use special readable codes like ~[[1m
instead of CRT[[1m, but then you have to have special clients which recognize
your secret codes, and other funky things.  It wont really happen in otherwords
(at least not on a large scale).

The thing which made me think about this was I have been talking to a large
part of the VR community here at USU, and a LARGE portion of them would, if
they had to make the choice, use raw telnet over a client--to get colored and
nifty ansi characters.

I realize that most/all the tiny family of muds does not use these characters,
well do I care about tradition?  :)

(As for having abuse of it, it may be possible to control unreadables through
$sys (dunno))
