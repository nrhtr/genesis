[Colin's ramblings about who should do what with the server and why he's been
touched by god to be the one and only True ColdMUD Developer(tm) deleted]

All I can say is that this message is the best indication so far of why you're
unfit to be in charge of anything that anybody else cares about, in my opinion.

Your attitude of "what I say goes because I've got my hands on the source code"
is rather akin to saying "I've got the gun so I get to decide who gets shot".
While perhaps a likely outcome of such a situation, that simple fact certainly
does not make it a desirable situation in the first place (desirable for anyone
besides you, that is), and it's exactly the kind of condition that generally
results in everyone having their own guns and nobody speaking to one another,
with a general populace afraid to walk the streets at night.

And your comments regarding your apparent feelings that anyone who isn't as
skillfully adept at the arts of programming and developent and system
administration and talking with god and whatever else you think makes you so
fucking special shouldn't get a say in the way this server develops are just
plain repulsive in my opinion.  Throw in a little racial bias and you'd make a
good nazi (if there can be said to be such a thing as a "good nazi").
