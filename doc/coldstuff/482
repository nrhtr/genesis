&gt; He isn't on this list because he wasn't added when he asked to
&gt; be. The alleved new version is at homer.ncm.com, but not released
&gt; because it's not done. If he released it unfinished y'all 'd write
&gt; nasty bug reports and he'd have to say you asked for it. We're all
&gt; getting tired of waiting, but we also have lives that should keep us
&gt; busy while we wait.

I added him to the list, but deleted him when his mail started
bouncing.  Like Pavel, I delete people after I see just one bounce,
and you have to notice and ask to be re-added yourself.  Sorry, but
there's not much else I can do without spending more time than I want
to.

Brandon, if you want to get back on the list, send me mail, and make
sure your email address works.

&gt; I wonder if this letter's tone is one of the reasons Greg bowed out?
&gt; Just a thought.

No, I'm just not interested in muds any more.  If you happen to be
interested in testing a new Usenet news server, send me mail; I should
have something ready in a few months. :)
