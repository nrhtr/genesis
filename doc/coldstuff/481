&gt; &gt; He is on the net sometimes, and not on this list and I have to forward
&gt; &gt;  stuff I think he cares about to him. (jbb@homer.ncm.com)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is being debugged by him. It works. It does not have the bugs you
&gt; &gt;  (Brandon) reported. The version you have was older and _alpha_.
&gt; 
&gt; So why the hell isn't he on this list and where the hell is this alleged new
&gt; version?  I'm getting rather fed up with this "I'm working on it but you
&gt; can't look at it and you can't talk to me" attitude, as I suspect most of the
&gt; other people around here are too.
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate the work that Jordan did to come out with the version of 0.12 that
&gt; we have at the moment and I would very much like to see what he's got now, and
&gt; since he's been the semi-official server maintainer and people said he was
&gt; working on it I've been waiting on him before tackling this stuff myself, but
&gt; I've about run out of wait and I think the least one or the other of you could
&gt; do is keep us up to date on all of this.

As my mother says, "You catch more bees with honey than vinegar."

I choose to answer as best I can simply because I want to promote coolness on
 the list.

He isn't on this list because he wasn't added when he asked to be. The alleved
 new version is at homer.ncm.com, but not released because it's not done. If
 he released it unfinished y'all 'd write nasty bug reports and he'd have to
 say you asked for it. We're all getting tired of waiting, but we also have
 lives that should keep us busy while we wait.

I wonder if this letter's tone is one of the reasons Greg bowed out? Just a
 thought.

Since when has a programmer ever met a deadline? Why would you ask for a date?
 No one is getting paid for any of this (yet) and if they are they should be
 nicer still.

I wonder why my mom thought I wanted to catch bees?
