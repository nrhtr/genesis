Brandon:

&gt; No, there wouldn't be any hole, since it would sequence like so:

&gt;   $sys.compile() is called with the code for $sys.log
&gt;     $sys.compile() logs being called and the vital stats (who, what, when, etc)
&gt;     $sys.compile() compiles the method.

&gt; No recursion...

Well, the hole I was speaking of was the logging hole when someone
hacked an admin and turned off logging. If you log the use of log, is
that recursive? (thats what i meant by it being recursive) I can see
why it wouldnt be, just not familier with how this is set up, so
wondeing if it is... If you put a log into $sys.log to log its use,
it'd be the builtin log instead of the $sys.log, i presume. im just
getting confused with all these logs rolling around.

I'd quote the log song, but i'd probably get hit. ;)
