&gt; I didn't look too closely at this patch, but am I right in thinking
&gt; that the ?= operator is a simple test of existing value, rather
&gt; then an operation which is only performed if a variable has not
&gt; been assigned to previously?
&gt; 
&gt; Perl has a useful:
&gt; 
&gt; 	$foo = $bar unless $foo;
&gt; 
&gt; construction, which only assigns a value to $foo if no previous
&gt; assignment has taken place.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't this be logic (expressed as '$foo ?= $bar') be more useful?
&gt; 

I might be wrong about this, but Perl, unlike Cold, has global variables.
In Cold, you /always/ know if the variable has been assigned (except
for object vars, but I'm not sure I'd like to see the exception). So,
this behaviour of ?= would be less useful. IMHO, at least. For optional
parameters in [] = ... assignment it still won't trigger if right hand
parameters exist but are false.
