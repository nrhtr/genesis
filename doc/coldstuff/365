I ran into ColdMUD accidently one day, downloaded it, compiled it,
printed the docs and became impressed by it.  Ok, so here I am all
impressed, with docs and a running server and still far from able
to do anything.  Don't get me wrong, I know how to code and have
done quite a bit of driver maintanance in my life.  But rather than
learn all the rules of this new driver from reading it end to end, I
am looking for a place that is running a ColdMUD.  I would like to
ask such questions as: What is the sequence of execution when the
system boots up?  When is eval called and in which objects?  And so
on.

I have an idea for a network-based game, not a MUD per se but I am
looking for a change from LP-based drivers and would like to implement
it in ColdMUD assuming I can get some simple answers.

Where do ColdMUD folks meet to talk?
