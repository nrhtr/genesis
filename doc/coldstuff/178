Well, my only point worth spewing (if you can call it worth it) is that
encapsulation is a Good Idea.  For instance:
Given Player_X and Programmer_Y:
y does:
;$player_x.passwd(crypt("newpassword")); // OK, make it proper C-- if it isn't
If you are not careful (OK, it's an extreme case, but IT COULD HAPPEN), it
would happen.  Granted, there are ways around this as it is, I suspect, but
I wouldn't know them, given the fact that I don't know the current core
well enough to suit me.  If you force each object to define set_param
methods, then you know exactly which params can be set by other objects.
As a 'programmer' who spends much of his private time being paranoid about
privacy (on the net? pfeh), this is a Good Thing.  YMMV,AIIDFT/dev/null
