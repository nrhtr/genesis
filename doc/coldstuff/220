I agree with richelieu on match_template, currently it DOES get in the user's
face by making decisions.  Having it a little more flexible would probably
clean up the problems, as then the database could set it how it wanted.  I
personally think that using ` instead of " would be the way to go.  Now I know
this is aside from normal standards, but for the usages we have it makes a lot
of sense.  First: " is a HEAVILLY used character in our style of muds.  From
simple "say" text to users quoteing everything they use the " character.  The
next most used character of this type would be ', which is used often in
punctuation.  But ` is rarely EVER used.  As Greg pointed out having the parser
spontaneously remove " from any string usually screws up things more than it
helps.  However spontaneously removing ` from any string (I'd say if its
matched, but that could get ugly) would rarely ever cause I problem, _I_ think. 
AND for how often it would have to be used, people would not mind the
difference (how often being rarely).
