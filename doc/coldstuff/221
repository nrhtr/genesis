We are moving the Office of Computer Services around the building right now,
 and in the process of moving recumbent, it's hard disk munched big time.
 What this means is recumbent is out of commission for at least the next few
 weeks.  However there is salvation.  We have gotten permission to use another
 machine.  THe IP Address is:

      129.123.1.63

It has two names:

     ybrick.declab.usu.edu
     chimaera.declab.usu.edu

chimaera is the one that will be staying, eventually.  Anyhow, I'll try to get
 it up soon.  We lost anything done since APril 27th.
