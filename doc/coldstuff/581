This could actually be a holdover from dumpsplit 1, but since I know virtually
nothing about perl I'm unable to track it down.  Basically about every ~5-10
objects is completely duplicated in it's file (i.e. all the param defines
and method defines, if they exist).  And occasionally it just completely
doesn't include a whole object (found this one out the hard way--the object
had no methods and was probably missing some params, I didn't bother to check).
