Thanks for the info on NDM.  I was able to verify the index.pag keys and
data were correct although implementation differs.  The objects file was
corrupted by the fopen() in Init_New_Database() in the binarydb.c module.
It specfied w+ for the mode instead of wb+.  I found a number of other places
where opens are not explicitly declared O_BINARY.
My Linux 'objects' file is identical to the win 'objects' file with the
exception of unused(?) or filler bytes.  These appear to be zeroed out
in Linux and garbage in Win.  Could this be a source of later problems
for me?  
In any event, it stays up and running until I attempt a connection. ;-)
A little more debugging and I may have something here.
