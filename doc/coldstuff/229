In-Reply-To: &lt;01HC6HFCBBIMBG4SCY@cc.usu.edu&gt; (message from the Lyncx on Tue, 10 May 1994 15:58:15 -0600 (MDT))

the Lyncx sed:

&gt; I want to have a Pow-Wow of whomever is interested.  What we will
&gt; discuss is the directions of development we will be taking with the
&gt; Cold Dark--and it's core--in the future.  Let us tenatively schedule
&gt; it for May 18th (Wednesday) at 5:00 pm (dont know how this works
&gt; with SamIAm/Australia).

I assume you mean mountain time? Thats 4:00 here (Pacific), so unless
we get netaccess by then I'll still be at work, but I havnt been very
prominent on ColdDark lately anyways :( mostly time things. Hopefully
when we get access here at work, I'll be able to do more
stuff. (although in general, when at work I have this odd tendancy to
uh, work. *grin*) But when i have windowed net-access life will be a
bit easier :)

 just some rambling

              I last got on ;)
