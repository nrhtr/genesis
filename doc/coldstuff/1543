I recently compiled 1.1.8 for Win32. I have applied patches from
coldstuff (Bruce's method-cache stuff, my random bugfixes, etc) to it.

I am offering the binaries to anybody who wants them.


A few things I noticed about Win32 genesis:
random() cannot return numbers higher than 32767. This is a library
issue which i forgot to patch. Maybe I'll remember later.

mtime() always returns 0. Also a library issue -- Win32 apparently
doesn't have a function to return microseconds.

ctime() and friends throw when given numbers &lt; 18000. Borland (what I
used to compile genesis) has a broken time utility which causes genesis
to crash when these functions are given low numbers.

The pids are negative. No idea why. Win32 thing I guess.

Some of the text files have CRLF (textdumps) and some have LF (logs).
Win95 edit seems to grok both.


The binaries are located at:
ftp://typhoon.rh.rit.edu/pub/genesis-1.1.8-win32-bin.zip

That's a pkzip-2.04g compatible zipfile containing genesis.exe and
coldcc.exe. If you want docs or anything else, get a tarball of source
or something.


I would appreciate it if somebody could put this on ftp.cold.org or
somewhere, as my ftp server is nowhere near permanent enough to work in
the long run. (Bandwidth is not much of a problem for me.)

Also, I am not able to test the executables as much as I would like. Any
and all (valid) bugreports are welcome.


Have fun!
</PRE>
