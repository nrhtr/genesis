I did the updates in Word for the 20+ people that are working with/for =
me on a new venture.  I chose Word because that's what I felt =
comfortable with and that's what the people I'm working with felt =
comfortable with.  Everyone can piss and moan about how crappy Word is, =
and how superior X format is, but Word is the format that the current =
update is in... =20

I offered them to Brandon (and/or cold.org) because I thought that the =
work that myself and Denise put in would be worthwhile for the =
furtherance of ColdC as a language.  The hurdle in converting my work =
from Word back to text is a small one.

I believe that Jeff has offered to translate the work into a number of =
different formats and I'm more than happy in the future to work in =
whatever format cold.org decides on for maintenance of the manual. =20
