Yes.  The is the only reason I personally support := is that I support
assignment as an expression.  However, I'd much rather have .= or '= for
assignment--much MUCH easier on the pinkies.

What I'd like to see is:

  =  as an assignment statement, as it is now.
  .= as an assignment expression.
  == as a comparison expression.
