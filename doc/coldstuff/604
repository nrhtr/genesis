&gt; &lt; Suspend causes a task to be stored in the internal table of suspended tasks.
&gt; &lt; It takes no args and returns a value specified by the resume() call or 0 if
&gt;   ----------------
&gt; 
&gt; I just started playing around with this recently.  Now forgive me if I am not
&gt; correctly understanding the implied usage of this function, but on the driver
&gt; I received from Jordan's archive site suspend() can only be called by $sys,
&gt; and since one would be unable to remotely suspend a method through a thunk,
&gt; restricting it to $sys means that only methods on $sys can be suspended, which
&gt; seems rather overly restrictive?  (Or am I just reading it wrong, the only
&gt; way I can figure out what it does is by playing with it and reading the code)
&gt; For now I've just removed the sys object checking, as I would like to play
&gt; around with it...

It suspends the current task. It does not manipulate the tick count. Use
 pause() to retore ticks. Write a $sys.suspend() to allow non-sys methods
 to suspend.

I do not understand 'unable to remotely suspend a method through a think'.
