It just occured to me that most of the checkpointing time is wasted on
cp - the database has to be copied clean. I thought of a way to keep the
database clean 95% of the time. This would also make the server a lot safer.

The thing that would have to be modified is the cache handling. I suggest
that modified objects could be kept in RAM till the next checkpoint, and
the checkpoint would be when a) 30 minutes (or whatever) passes, or b)
more than 75% of the cached objects are modified. Then we could dump
just the modified objects, and the database would be non-clean only during
the dump, the cp being unnecessary.

What do you all think about this?
