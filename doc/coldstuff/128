I got the IP address wrong for Cold World; it's 18.177.1.175.  My
apologies.  The network people here messed up the cname for glacier
(updated a commented-out line in the hostnames file), so it'll take me
a few more days to get it sorted out.

I decided to do the buffer mods for 1.0 instead of for a 1.x version.
They seem to work fine.  Thus, Coldmud 1.0 will have raw network I/O.
The parse method will receive a buffer argument instead of a string
argument, and echo() accepts a buffer instead of a string.  I expect
to release a Cold World 0.6 along with Coldmud 1.0 that will support
these changes.  It turns out that a quick hack to $connection is all
that's necessary.

I still haven't been able to reproduce or locate the
missing-dictionary-entry bug.  I'll keep looking.  I'm also getting
peculiar behavior with destroyed objects showing up in objects' child
lists when you shutdown and restart from a binary database; I suspect
I'm not setting the dirty bit properly, now that I think bout it.
I've also already corrected a slew of minor bugs.

Because I've done more changes than I expected to for 1.0, and have
only ten days before the release date, I will mail out beta versions
of the code to people who are interested (send me mail).  I won't make
a "beta release" via ftp, because my numbering system doesn't account
for that, and it's silly anyway.
