There is clearly a fixed buffer size for retrieving packets from TCP/IP.
If a line is sent that is longer then that buffer, it arrives as two or
more subsequent calls to the relevant parse method.

Not a big prob to deal with but it should be documented.  Took me a day to
track it down as the cause of a bug I was seeing (partly 'cause i was just
stupid and what was happening didn't occur to me until fairly late in the
day.)
