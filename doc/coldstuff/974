Ok, it sounds like the general concept is accepted (assuming this since 
everybody I talked to and those on the list instantly jumped to syntax :)

Frankly I would rather use 'user()' because it is short, it is not always 
conceptually correct--which is also a large drawback for me.  The two goals
I have with naming it are: ease of use (I really dont like long function 
names in high-use positions) and appropriateness.  Since I plan on 
evolving ColdC more and more to handle more tasks, I'd like to keep 
appropriateness in mind.  Anybody have a thesarus?  :)  Suggestions on 
the table:

     controller()      -- most appropriate, too bulky and long
     server()
     con()
     user()
     requestor()
     client()

(I forget any others...)

I'm actually liking 'client()' or 'server()' (both are appropriate, 
depending upon the point of view you are taking).
