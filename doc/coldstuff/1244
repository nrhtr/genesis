I seem to have forgotten how to use the html stuff in Cold.
For example, I thought that the start.html went in the root
directory where the database is.  But I get "not found" error
messages when I try to access that file with a browser.

I also don't know what I'm suppose to put in the .../login/
file; is that an index.html?

I don't need detailed answers, but just a pointer or two
of what I'm suppose to be looking.

I also wonder if there is a editor for editing the 
complex html descriptions that are embedded in the Cold
database or is the idea to @dump the object and then use
a regular text editor.  An example of this is motd.  There
is a lot of html stuff and not an obvious way of how I can
edit it.

I'm using genesis p23 and database A6.

Frank
