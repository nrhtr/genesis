There are some methods in ColdCore-3.0-ALPHA2 which could cause
problems for clients which operate in 'line mode'.  .write("something",
'non_terminated) has the effect of flushing a string to the connection
without terminating it with a CR.  tkMOO-light (yawn) is currently
geared up to cope with 'gets' reads, that is, it expects information
to appear in lines terminated with CR.

Issuing the @shutdown command causes a prompt:

    Do you really want to? [yes]:

or some similar string which only appears *after* the bemused user
has typed [return] to free up what appears to be a hanged connection.

So, this isn't a bug report, just a note that -light gets screwed
by the current core.  I may find time to explore turning my well
formed gets's into really hairy read's, possibly before hell cools
a little.

Oh well.

Ay.
