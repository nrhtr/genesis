&gt; I didn't look too closely at this patch, but am I right in thinking
&gt; that the ?= operator is a simple test of existing value, rather
&gt; then an operation which is only performed if a variable has not
&gt; been assigned to previously?
&gt; 
&gt; Perl has a useful:
&gt; 
&gt; 	$foo = $bar unless $foo;
&gt; 
&gt; construction, which only assigns a value to $foo if no previous
&gt; assignment has taken place.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't this be logic (expressed as '$foo ?= $bar') be more useful?
&gt; 
&gt; Ay (prepared to be clueless...)

IMHO no--perl's "unless" drives me up the wall (along with a few of its
other operators).  It changes the focus from left to right to right to
left simply for the fact that then it can use a cute word rather than an
operator and it supposedly makes 'sense' as you read it. Using ?= stays
left oriented, and fits in with existing operators, and is also shorter :) 
(it also 'reads' better IMHO):

   [foo, bar, 10 unless baz] = [1, 2]

vs:

   [foo, bar, baz ?= 10] = [1, 2]

And that is just in a simple scatter assignment :)
