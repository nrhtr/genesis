Original quote by BRANDON@cc.usu.edu:

&gt; set_heartbeat_freq() =&gt; set_heartbeat()     (this is completely aesthetic)
&gt; db_top =&gt; max_objnum()                      (ditto)

I support the above.  Two builtins that were misnamed.  I like the 
above suggestions.

&gt; has_ancestor() =&gt; remove  (we can just do 'if obj in (.ancestors())', although
&gt;                            it isn't as fast).

What's the speed difference?  If the speed difference is a large one, 
then by all means leave has_ancestor() in, but it doesn't seem like it 
should be very large.

&gt; dict_add_elem()
&gt; dict_del_elem() =&gt; remove (since they are disappearing anyway)

I know I have very important code that uses both of these extensively.  
I'd like to have them left in personally.  I know it can be done in db, 
but how quickly?  Speed again is the consideration.  If it can be done in 
the database without considerable loss of speed, then nevermind. . .
