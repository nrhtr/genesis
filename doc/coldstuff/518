&lt; When DB size exceeds cache, objects/parameters/changes disappear spuriously

Just for reference, I've been running 0.12.0 in Ultrix for at least 2 (?)
months, with no problem.  It is probably an OS specific thing (Linux?  If so,
somebody try to track down the problem in dbm and mail the slackware guys?)

&lt;   todbref(int)              =&gt; toobj(int)

The more I think about it, I think we should change all the 'to*()' function
syntaxes to be more standard, rather than using abbreviations.  For instance:

tostr()     =&gt;  to_string()
toint()     =&gt;  to_int()
toliteral() =&gt;  to_literal()
toobj()     =&gt;  to_objnum()

(etc)

&lt;     ebin/           -- directory where execute() programs are located

Actually (cosmetic here), I'd prefer executables/ or exe_bin/, or hmm,
execute_bin/ (hsm), perhaps execute/  (sigh).

&lt; [pipes]   Anyway, what do people think?

I like the idea of doing it through the same method as a connection, less
duplicity in-db (since it is doing the same thing).

&lt; buffer_to_strings()        =&gt; ascii_buffer_to_strings()
&lt; strings_to_buffer()        =&gt; strings_to_ascii_buffer()

I would prefer:

buffer_to_strings(buf)       =&gt; buffer_to_strings(buf, ['type])
strings_to_buffer(buf)       =&gt; strings_to_buffer(buf, ['type])

Where 'type defines what type of conversion to do (default 'ascii).

&lt; "locked" compilation flag for nethods

"private" would be good too, in my opinion (would remove a lot of perm
checking which simply checks to make sure it is called by this object).

Also, I would (still) like to see the assignment operator change from '='
to ':='.  I believe it would seriously help lessen confusion in the language,
in relation to people learning the language.
