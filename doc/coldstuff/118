&gt;Well, anyone who wants to contribute to a single 'definative more then the
&gt;basics core' please let me know.  Bare core is good, but like Lambdacore,
&gt;most systems want at least the basics built already.

I am also working on a core that is in a slightly different style then
the one that other people are working on... If you want to team up
and compare notes drop me a line.  I'm looking to create a core that
is more accessable to the TinyMUD family people out there, because
that's one way to attract them.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm willing to create a manual for coding (since I'll be learning it at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same time, should be a good beginner's intro by the time I get done.) so
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm looking for as much solid stuff to build a good core as I can get.
&gt;&gt;Did you see Greg's Manual?
&gt;
&gt;You talking about coldmud.info or the postscript stuff?  I haven't looked
&gt;at the ps stuff yet.

Take a look at it... the ps stuff is fairly good, though could use more
examples.
