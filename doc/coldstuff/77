Each,

	Paul Richards (paul@isl.cf.ac.uk) is one of the FreeBSD core developers,
and I've just clued him in to the special needs of Cold/MOO systems so far as
free PC unix is concerned.  If you'd like to know a bit more, OS-wise then you
should get in contact with him.

&gt; Subject: Best Platform for ColdMUD?
&gt; Content-Length: 1430
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; 	You may remember a question or two I posted a couple of weeks
&gt; ago.  In a nutshell, a friend of mine, Scott, wants to start up a BBS
&gt; running some sort of MUD.  I'm talking him into using ColdMUD, because
&gt; I think it's nifty.  I could really use some advice on the platform.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Question is, what's the best platform to set it up on, taking
&gt; into account feasibility and cost?  And what's the best way to
&gt; establish connectivity?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Scott just went out and purchased a Packard Bell 486 DX 66Mhz
&gt; with 8meg of ram and a 400-odd meg hard drive, but he can still return
&gt; it if it's horribly wrong (Best Buy 30-day "no questions asked" return
&gt; policy).
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm assuming that running Linux or some other brand of free
&gt; UNIX for x86 machines is best.  How do FreeBSD and such measure up
&gt; against Linux?

Paul knows the answer to this one I think.

&gt; 
&gt; 	What kind of a load (disk space, RAM, CPU) would ColdMUD
&gt; impose on a regular UNIX system (i.e. what if he rents space on one of
&gt; Netcom's systems, or Colorado SuperNet?)?
&gt; 
&gt; 	We're based in Denver, Colorado.  Scott wants to eventually
&gt; set up a multi-line BBS for players, but right now he's looking for
&gt; the most cost-effective method to run the system in a "development"
&gt; mode; probably SLIPping into Netcom or something similar, to allow the
&gt; developers to connect and work on stuff.  He's not independently
&gt; wealthy, but he's committed to doing this; any suggestions for the
&gt; most cost-effective method?
&gt;

Greg?  Could you subscribe Paul to this mailing list ASAP as well?

Thanks,
Andy.

Paul:	ColdMUD is a multiple-inheritance object-oriented multi-user database
	system/programming environment/VR engine, in some ways similar to Pavel
	Curtis' MOO system.  Cold is newer and still in the developement stage
	but due to its platform	friendly design (a disk based db rather than a
	memory based one for MOO) it's generating a lot of interest.  To
	be honest, this is one of the new breed.
