I realize Greg has yet to be completely resurrected, but i'm posting this so I
dont forget...

First: ancestor defined parameters on children.

You cannot removeremove them, p  Crag mentioned this to Greg and Greg said it
was a 'feature'.  I believe that being able to hose the parent parameter and
have the children's parameters stay is a feature, not being able to remove the
childrens parameters, AT ALL, is a bug.  (at all in db--you can always edit the
textdump--which is the only option available currently).

This showed up when I rearranged $described.  I hosed ,description from
$described, and suddenly realized that all the children still had it defined (I
knew this would happen, just never...realized it I guess).  Not even that,
there was no way of accessing the parameters!  They existed, but nothing I had
would access them (i.e. get the value).  Very frustrating indeed.  Perhaps a
'add/del _inherited_parameter (hsm).  Dunno, but something is needed, oh, and a
get_inherited_var(), hsm, SOMETHING (feh).

Next: some sort of method tracing (like method())

This is stretching it, I know, but it would be extremely nice.  Basically its
the method that called the current method... perhaps last_method() or
something.  In cooperation with this, it would be nice to have stack() which
would keep track of all objects/methods called in this stack (like a traceback,
but accessible--not strings).
