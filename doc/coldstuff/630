&lt; Heh.  the two main problems seem to be 1) getting everyone to agree on
&lt; what changes to be made and 2) getting someone to maintain and coordinate
&lt; the entire effort.

I've been doing some work on my own driver, on the side.  Since I didn't feel
like dealing with the 'politics' on this list, I'm calling it something
original like ColdX.  The main reason for splitting is to do my own hacks
without having to try to convince others they are a good idea.

(I've already got some changes made, including part of a signal handler, and
I plan on integrating FP sometime).

&lt; What do people think of some sort of option config file for cold?

I've already got it, using the same system I made for the netrek server.  I
also have a setup script which sets the available options (prompting for
what you want).  This is different from the configure script, which creates
the makefiles.

&lt; nice cores could even have some sort of library object that will do in-db
&lt; emulation (if possible) of the requested function if it's not present...

I think Crag was working on in-db FP at one point (on tCD) I do not how far he
got with it (sorry, random trivia).
