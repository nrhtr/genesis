&gt;	This discussion has been had, many times, on rec.games.mud.*.
&gt; ANSI escape codes are _not_ a good thing to put into the server.  If
&gt; you want to do color hiliting, etc, have a flag the player can set
&gt; which enables this, and have him load triggers into his tf, which
&gt; supports color hiliting in the later version.  Basically, design a
&gt; protocol so that the server can send display independant information,
&gt; and the client can translate this into whatever is appropriate
&gt; behaviour for the local display.

hrm, perhaps somebody would be willing to create up the appropriate .vtc file
for vaportalk, and whatever it would be called for tinyfugue, with the
appropriate triggers?  I'd be willing to code up ColdMUD's end.  This may
already be done, as I have heard of some type of format, but I dont know if it
uses either tf or vt...

Anyhow, there is a difference between saying to do said format, and making it
easy and available for EVERYBODY.
