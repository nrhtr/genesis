Just some comments on this whole thing....

FreeBSD currently ships by default with MD5 (yes that includes source code).
Anyone from anywhere can retrieve and use this distribution.  They also ship
separately a DES encryption module for people who want DES, but this is only
available to people within the US.

In a similar vein to Greg Hudson's comments, I am not a lawyer. However, this 
seems to me to pretty much suggest you can ship MD5 without any hassles.  You
might want to go look at the EFF homepage, which has links to info about the
court challenges to the restrictions on shipping DES (we don't really want
ColdX to be classified as a munition ;).
