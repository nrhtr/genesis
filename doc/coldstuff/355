&lt; As I said, I did not just now go look at the code, but if I were writing the
&lt;  server, I would do it this way. It is not a great mystery to me, and it
&lt;  doesn't bother me. Just use your scheduler to make the announcement go out
&lt;  one tick before the text_dump() call.

I have had it this way for ages, but I want to take it out of the scheduler,
because $scheduler uses .as_this_run(), which causes a log entry to log() for
using compile() on sys, which I want to hack out.

&lt; wondering why this is still a question when everyone has a copy of the code.

Because most people have a lot more to do than sift through miles of yet more
unknown code?
