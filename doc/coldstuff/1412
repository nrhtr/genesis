To: coldstuff@cold.org

It is available, changes list:

      * fixed a few minor memory leaks (Bruce)
      * fixed a maxint comparison problem (Brad)
      * reduced unecessary buffer copies when reading data from a
        connection, as well as redundant mallocs (Brandon)
      * fixed some problems with cancelling tasks straight from the
        driver (i.e. with kill -USR1) which caused a crash (Brandon)
      * fixed a problem with set_method_access()--was not complaining
        if the method did not exist (Bruce)
      * added the ability to do `[buf] * INT like on strings (Brad)
      * fixed a problem with the VEIL module (Brandon)
      * added the System/OS token as an element to $sys.version() (Brandon)
      * fixed a problem with cancelling or getting info on the currently
        executing task (Brandon)
      * adjusted select() to also check for file descriptors with
        exceptions--allowing for later cleanup (Brandon)

For those wondering about Brian's BIG_FLOAT patches--I am going to branch
1.1-DEV from this release and include them.
