&gt;Perhaps we do not need to change the assignment operator, but rather
&gt;we need to change the equals operator?  By not changing the assignment
&gt;operator it would leave the door open to adding '-=' and '+='...
&gt;Perhaps &lt;&gt; for equal to?...

Interesting idea but &lt;&gt; is not a good idea as it means "not equal" in basic
(literally greater then or less then.)

Its important for operators to have logical consistancy so if w are goign
to address the issue, we should address it all at once.

Actually == DOES have a logical consistancy in C:
        &gt;=  - Greater then or equal to
        &lt;=  - less then or equal to
        ==  - equal to
Though I admit a single = woudl also be reasonably consistant.  On a
persoanl level, I like &lt;- for assignment and = for testing, BUT I still
think utility is best served by sticking to the existiung ANSI C standards.
