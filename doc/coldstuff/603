&lt; Suspend causes a task to be stored in the internal table of suspended tasks.
&lt; It takes no args and returns a value specified by the resume() call or 0 if
  ----------------

I just started playing around with this recently.  Now forgive me if I am not
correctly understanding the implied usage of this function, but on the driver
I received from Jordan's archive site suspend() can only be called by $sys,
and since one would be unable to remotely suspend a method through a thunk,
restricting it to $sys means that only methods on $sys can be suspended, which
seems rather overly restrictive?  (Or am I just reading it wrong, the only
way I can figure out what it does is by playing with it and reading the code)
For now I've just removed the sys object checking, as I would like to play
around with it...
