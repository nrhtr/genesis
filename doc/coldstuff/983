I vote for user(), because it's short, and I'm lazy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I agree with Quinn, 'issuer' sounds more generic, if not, I vote

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you want generic, try 'initiator()'. Personally, I'd really like
&gt; &gt; something like that. There are quite a lot of times when I'd like to pin
&gt; &gt; down where  .tell() came from (usually from a room announce, from some
&gt; &gt; code on a user, started by...who? Being able to get the dbref of the
&gt; &gt; enactor would be a BIG help).
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, from discussions here and numerous online I'm personally narrowing it 
&gt; down to one of:
&gt; 
&gt;       origin()
&gt;       user()
&gt; 
&gt; Both of which work.  The primary bonus of 'user()' is it is short, and
&gt; should be easy to pickup by most beginning users--but it is not as
&gt; appropriate in more proffesional applications (however, it is also not
&gt; absolutely inappropriate either).  The drawback to 'origin()' is that it
&gt; doesn't imply you can change it (of course, it doesn't imply you can't
&gt; either.. ;) I'm going to be making these changes soon, of these two which
&gt; do people prefer?
