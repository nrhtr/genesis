&gt; The definer is optional.  Follow that by a semi colon and then the normal
&gt; eval from that point on.  This replaces both:
&gt; 
&gt;     @def xxx as yyy eval zzz        =&gt;    ;as yyy&lt;xxx&gt;; zzz
&gt;     @as yyy eval zzz                =&gt;    ;as yyy; zzz

Thanks.  That's at least one reason to get Alpha 5,  Btw, I've just
started
looking at the whole database-- there's a lot of code.  Good job
to the whole crew!

I'm looking at how to easy or hard it would be to implement intermud3 
	http://www.imaginary.com
for intermud communication (the '97 buzzword huh? Connect now with 
your Sega to the to the Intermud! SEGA!!!). Anyway, if I can actually
get to the coding part, I hope to get the intermud3 hooked up so
that I can join other muds in the same network (mostly LP and a couple
Diku muds).

Intermud3 has the following features:
	-mudlist to show what muds are up, type, address, databases
	-remote tell with emotes
	-remote who
	-finger
	-intermud mail (based on the mud name not the address)
	-ftp/telnet
	-plus some other stuff I don't know about
Everything goes through an intermud server.

I'm also talking to some people at Electric Communities about using
their version of Java language called E (for enhanced Java) that 
includes some security stuff.  Maybe something to consider for Cold 2.0.
The lanuage is free and available from:
	http://www.communities.com
Their stuff is in *.class, but a good decompiler will rebuild the
source.

Later,

Frank
