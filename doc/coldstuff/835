Right now it is possible to have more than one connection sending/receiving
with an object.  For various reasons I am changing this, what I want to
know is:

   When a new connection attempts to 'bind' to an object, should we:

       1: close the older connection, perhaps call obj.abort (or similar)
       2: deny the new connection

I can see advantages with both, if your db is not functioning correctly
and you accidentally try to bind a new connection to an object already
serving a connection, the old one would get bumped, possibly disconnecting
the developer.  Of course, this is a rare case and is due to bad coding
on their behalf anyway.

I will probably do #1

The main reason is that for cleanliness I only think you should have one
connection per object, it is cleaner this way...
