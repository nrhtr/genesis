&gt; 
&gt; 1) Where the heck can I find some good documentation on the ColdCore (I 
&gt; know, I'm dreaming, right?) 

Yep! For now. :)

&gt; 
&gt; 2) Will ColdCore Indeed do the kinda 'relational' system I'm looking for.

There will be a system that keeps the spatial relations between objects - 
we need some way to generate VRML from the room contents. :)

&gt; 
&gt; 3) Will it be easier to take ColdCore, delete all the frills that I don't  
&gt; want in my core, or go ahead and start from Minimal and go up?

Did you think about keeping the rooms we have now and parenting
all the objects intended to keep other objects to it?

After all, with multiple parenting you don't need to think too much about
changing the stuff. :)
