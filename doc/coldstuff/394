Greets folks:

Exactly how close is there  to a release of  a building-level Core for
ColdMUD?  I just need about the  same level of functionality one might
find in MUSH, room  and  exit creation, succ/osucc/odrop, descs,  etc.
I've finally got my own site available which  I'd like to create an RP
heavy MUD with an inbuilt RPG.

The logically  best way to  impliment  it  would be under  Cold,  with
encapsulation and OOP, but I don't want to code the same functionality
that should be   in  a core,  myself.  So,   how  close are  we   to a
release-potential core?

(In a postscriptum: You  know, it'd be  awfully nice if in addition to
C, Cold took programs in LISP syntax too.  :) )
