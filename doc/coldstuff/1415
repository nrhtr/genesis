<HR><H2>[COLD] Heretical Question</H2>

I've been re-evaluating my Kelvin design as I get deeper and deeper into
my current cold based project.  I've come up with a rather heretical
question...

How important IS run-time receivability of the "class" structure (yes I
know Cold is classless but that's the easiest way to phrase what Im asking.)

I know many people are used to on-line editing of their object defs, but
when push comes to shove, for a production environment what are the real
advantages?

Does it add significantly to the expressive power of the language or
maintainability of applications in real-world use? How so?

I'm asking because this feature has all sorts of implications that result
in late binding and visualizations.  Without it, one could really write
such a  system right on top of the JAVA VM rather then on a second layer of
VM ontop of that.

Pls consider your answers carefully.

Thx.
