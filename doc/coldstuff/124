&gt;#&gt;I'm looking to create a core that is more accessable to the TinyMUD
&gt;#&gt; family people out there, because that's one way to attract them.
&gt;#
&gt;#What does that mean `accessable to the TinyMUD family'?  Isn't that
&gt;# taking a step backwards?  After MOO, tinymuds seem so awkward and
&gt;# primitive to me.
[snip]
&gt; You can have OO in and out your ass three ways past Wednesday, but I
&gt; still want a server with @dig, @link, @find, @open... I can't tell yet
&gt; whether this will be doable in Cold, but as TeenyMud 2.0 looks like it
&gt; will never be released, I'm hoping to find alternatives.  It'd be a
&gt; damn shame to toss a 17k object db.

I'm still confused as to howcome you cannot have an interface like that.  The
interface is however you &lt;big word&gt; well make it. All you have to do is hose a
few commands and rename them.  User interface is the most trivial thing in
ColdMUD.  I beleive that coldworld (greg's core) has prolly less than 20 line
commands when you begin--and they ARE based off the Tiny family like
commands...
