&gt;Hello, I have a couple questions that hopefully someone can help me with.
&gt;1) Is ANSI colors supported what so ever inside the code? I was wanting to add 
color to $body.say_cmd and a few others.

Boy havent talked abt this sicne my old BBS days... BUT...

Thast easy enough. ANSI graphics are just old-style terminal escape sequecnes so 
get yourself a chart and add them to your strings (or write a function that does 
so automiaticly form a higher level inertface to set the color and such.)

The BIg trick is switchign between that and regular text sicne ANSI, unlike 
telnet, provides no neotiation protocol.  Usually BBS's begai nwith a line thats 
said something like "If yhis is RED, type Y, else type n" whewn you logged in 
the first time and made an account, then theys torefd that info on your account.

have fun.

&gt;2) I recently was working with $described.description and noticed sender() 
returns $the_pit or whereever you are located. Is there something I can use to 
return the user like $user_soth? I'm trying to check to see if the user has a 
certain flag in a variable I've created named pflags so was wanting to check 
if(flag in pflags). 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help and advice,
&gt;soth

Thought to meditate on:

No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite different 
from any other two apples in the world.

Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
