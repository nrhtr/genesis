&gt;Of course keeping it in a word format is also an option, just not on my
&gt;list ;)

I THINK this falls into "if your gonna sue volunteers ya gotta let em use the 
tools they're comofrtable with". The vast majority of the non-geek world 9and i 
thin keven the good majoprity of the geek world) have moved beyond text editor 
and lay out macros And don't really want to return.

Best solution would be to find a reasonable intermiediary from that word can 
write and that can be translated automaticly to what you want, Brandon.
(As a side note, you CAN read PDF, if you can run Java. There is a JAVA PDF 
viewer available form Adobe.)

Word writes a LOT of formats. One I knwo f thats suppsoed top be resonably 
portable is RTF...

Thought to meditate on:

No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite different 
from any other two apples in the world.

Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
