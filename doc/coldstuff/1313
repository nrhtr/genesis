Hi,

	In what respects was tkMOO-light a bit too wobbly for your tastes?
the client is being actively developed, with new versions being made
available every couple of weeks.  I make a point of listening to good
suggestions and I'm always looking for new insights which may enhance
the client.

If you let me know what's wrong then perhaps I can, er, reduce the wobble.

Cheers,
Ay.

&gt; 
&gt; What clients do people like the best to use with the ColdCore?
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a NT Workstation, but I also have an X Terminal, on my desk.  I
&gt; am running Cold on a Linux box.  When working on moo, I like to use
&gt; XEmacs.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been using Pueblo to talk to the Cold mud.  I tried tkMOO-light,
&gt; but it was a bit too wobbly for my tastes.  I'd prefer something
&gt; strongly X or NT based that works well with Cold.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
