This sounds like MOO's standard operation for decendants. Which I've 
really missed in ColdX. Variables default to the value defined above them 
in the public instance... I think the private, protected and public words 
sound strange when used in this respect, but I would find these features 
make more commonsense than the current system where you need to define 
values over and over again, which is bad programming in my mind.
