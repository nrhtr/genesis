Well, actually the main problem with allowing both = and := is that it
doesnt actually solve the clueless newbies error fo doing x = 5 when
they mean x == 5. Not that I think := does. As I said, I think its a
problem with not remembering ==, not with misusing =. (or at least it
has been in my experience.)

Colin:

&gt; In my opinion, the act of changing the server to accomodate specific
&gt; learning difficulties (like an inability to comprehend `=') is
&gt; dirty.  It's a notational convention, and I believe the assertion
&gt; that there are people out there who can simultaneously have real
&gt; difficulty with '=', and still produce worthwhile code is false.

a tad harsh, but such is life. 

If (when) assignment in expression becomes an issue again, I'd give
this whole problem more weight, as the only time I've ever seen x = 1
cause trouble is when its in an if in C code, and its not readily
apparent that its an error. Even then, its a matter of experience. One
must make these mistakes, and later laugh about it. (Gee, the server
crashed cus i set reallyimportantparameter = 0, instead of testing its
value! -- Gee you shouldnt be setting parameters like that, its bad OO ;)

I do see your point, though, Brandon. =: is obviously different from
==, I just dont really thing it will help as much as you seem to, or
enough to be worth the change. (especially as I'm one of those
fortunates who skipped pasqal and have no habits of using ':=' )


Mmm, lets switch to APL!
