[snip]
&gt; any idea when the coldcore may be released for the engine? I 
&gt; am wanting to start converting a MOO over to it.

(Sorry for forwarding to a public list, I figured others would want to know).

We are actually considering making a volatile release of the core, with 
the idea that you do _not_ change any of the core objects, but you can 
feel free to expand upon the core.  This way upgrading to the new core 
will be as simple as:

    coldcc -p -t coldcore.db

ColdCC is getting a few more features, notably one which will mark 
objects that may contain local variables (such as $sys), so that it will 
go interactive on what to do (letting you make the decision).

If nobody has a problem with this, I suspect we can see a core within a week.
