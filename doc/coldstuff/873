&gt;&gt; 2) Will ColdCore Indeed do the kinda 'relational' system I'm looking for.
&gt;There will be a system that keeps the spatial relations between objects - 
&gt;we need some way to generate VRML from the room contents. :)

Good point.  Need to study up on VRML to see if its got the same 
direction as I wanna go.

&gt;&gt; 3) Will it be easier to take ColdCore, delete all the frills that I don't 
&gt;&gt; want in my core, or go ahead and start from Minimal and go up?
&gt;
&gt;Did you think about keeping the rooms we have now and parenting
&gt;all the objects intended to keep other objects to it?
&gt;
&gt;After all, with multiple parenting you don't need to think too much about
&gt;changing the stuff. :)

Hrmm... I'll have to give that some serious thought.  The reason I thought
about doing from the Minimal up was simply that, the scope of calculations
that I *eventually* want to encompass (line of sight, 'hearing' based more
on distance between objects rather than in a room, and other things
that need to be based strictly on one objects position relative to another,
rather than a 'grouping' by rooms which may or may not have any relation
to size, etc) is going to be a CPU killer I think.  My though was to
start fresh, and leave alot of the things that I *don't* need out so as
to save ticks/etc.  However, I will have to look much more deeply into
ColdCore to make these decisions.

Ok, so now who do I bombard with email to get docs updated and a ColdCore
compatible with Genesis .3 ??

P.S.  First one that tells me to get off my keister and finish it myself,
had better be prepared for the end result :)

   If Bill Clinton is the answer, it must be one very stupid question.
