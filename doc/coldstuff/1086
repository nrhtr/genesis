Recently, I encountered a problem where certain floating point operations would throw ~fpe for no good reason (if they were called again immediately, they worked).  I think I've traced this to caught_fpe being set true from a previous SIGFPE unrelated to the current FP operation.  In the macros MATH_HOOK_FPE_2 and MATH_HOOK_FPE, I added "caught_fpe = 0; \" right before "r = _math_  (( ..." and this seems to have cleared it up.  There may be other places where this should be done, though.
