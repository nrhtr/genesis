On a new core of mine, I have written a permission system that is based
on an individual method's perms.  In order to decide if the previous
method has permission to call this method, I would need some way of
knowing the method's name...  I think there should be a caller_method()
function written.  For now, I am having to use stack()[2][3]... Which is
very slow.  (I also think a speedier stack(1), which doesn't get line
numbers, would also be useful)... Any thoughts on this?
