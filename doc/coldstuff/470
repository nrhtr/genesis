&lt; I'll hapily dnate some space on serial for the archive site.
&lt; I've started by making pub/coldmud and stuffing everything that looked
&lt; coldmudish in incoming into there - anyone want to volunteer to maintain it?
&lt; Crag?  I'll also see what I can do about setting up a web server there in order
&lt; to support some Coldmud web pages, if anyone is interested in writing such 
&lt; things.

Well, serial is ungodly slow (Sorry zachary, but it is, took me nearly 10
minutes to download something from it one time).  If there is dire need for an
archive I have an Alpha machine with ~1 gig of space available, which is also
sitting directly on the router to the T1-&gt;T3 (i.e. kickin net connection).

But, since Jay volunteered why not let it be at neu (since there already is a
nice MUD archive there...).
