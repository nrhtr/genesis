&gt;&gt; This is a pointless religous debate I fear.
&gt;
&gt;     Then why are you debating it? :-)

Good idea. lets not.

(1) Unchangeable fact.  The new manual is in word format.
(2) Issue: brandon can't read Word, also i beoieve Brandoin wants more then a
read only copy.
(3) Offer: I've already fofered to do a PDF translation which certainly solves 
readability though may not solve brandon's write problem.
(4) Unless somebody else is offering to either do a hand translation, write 
debug and maintain a tool that translates from a word supported format, or 
translate by hand, the only other formats available are ones word can write.

So the only real issue on the table, to my knowlegde, is what format which Word 
can write would Brandon (and perhapse others) like a copy in?


All the rest of this is nosnense and noise.

Thought to meditate on:

No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite different 
from any other two apples in the world.

Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
