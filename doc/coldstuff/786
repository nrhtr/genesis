869683 Gillespie Brandon James drew these hieroglyphs:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt; There is a difference.  In a delayed fork, the task doesn't exist
&gt; &lt; until it runs, and in a fork-then-pause, it does.  This does make a
&gt; &lt; difference.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you know this?  I havn't even written it yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, whether the task exists or not is irrelevant, it still has to
&gt; duplicate the current execution frame.  The task itself is just a pointer
&gt; to that frame.  If I were to implement it with delay, it would exist from
&gt; the second it was forked in the task list, because it would exists as an
&gt; execution frame.

ah.  i was going off of MOO.  Then again, delayed forked tasks may
very well exist before beginning.  I'm really not sure anymore,
actually.

Can't think of a situation where it's relevant, either -- I thought I
did, but not anymore.

I used to be uncertain, now I'm not sure.
