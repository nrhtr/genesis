Arrg, seems that Pine didn't escape '.' when it sent it through SMTP, so  
the rest of my message disappeared into the bit bucket.  Here it is
again...

&gt; 1. How do I create a new mail list on Coldcore.  I tried @new and @spawn
&gt; on $mail_list, but that wasn't the right approach.

Hmm, @spawn or @new should both work.  Infact, it just did work:

% @spawn $mail_list
Spawned new object mail_list_9 ($mail_list_9) from the mail_list ($mail_list).
% @rename $mail_list_9 *mailtest
Renamed "mail_list_9" to "*mailtest".
% @send *mailtest -edit
-- Enter text for mail message, "." when done or "@abort" to abort --
Test
[period here]
Subject: test
Mail sent.
@mail on *mailtest
Mail from 1-1 on *mailtest:
   1  !test                                   Brandon      1  12-Jan-1998

&gt; 2. Is there a way to have mail to and from the cold server so that I
&gt; could do stuff like frankc@maddog.com.  I see the $smtp object but I
&gt; don't know how to use it.

Yuppers.  I've even made more improvements recently... But basically,
outgoing mail should work by just calling $smtp.sendmail()--I can't recall
what has to be set on the a9 server.  As for incoming mail--this can be
done too.  Full instructions at:

    http://www.cold.org/sitenames

Infact, the list 'coldcore@cold.org' is subscribed to by the Cold
Dark--and anything sent to *coldcore on the Cold Dark is simply forwarded
to the internet list.  Most of this is likely newer code tho...
