&gt; &gt;It'd be nice if cold supported floating point, even if only as a compile-time
&gt; &gt;option. As I understand, it has this capability, but it is unimplemented.
&gt; Yes that would be nice... waitaminnit.. if it's unimplemented, how can it be considered a
&gt; 'capability' ?

I mean, as I recall, when the driver was designed, the writer had this
ability in mind, which would mean that it wouldn't be extremely unhealthy
to implement.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It would be nice if we had someone who would take charge and make all the
&gt; &gt;changes we all agree upon. Someone who everyone agreed upon, who was
&gt; &gt;wel familiar with coldmud and C, and who had the time and energy. Any
&gt; &gt;volunteers?
&gt; 
&gt; Heh.  the two main problems seem to be 1) getting everyone to agree on what changes to be
&gt; made and 2) getting someone to maintain and coordinate the entire effort.
&gt; 
&gt; What do people think of some sort of option config file for cold?  This would be a way
&gt; to enable/disable 'features' that are 'nonstandard'.  Features like floating point, 
&gt; suspend/resume, etc..  Setting these up in your config file would, perhaps, add some
&gt; particular symbols to $sys or something so objects can check to see if these features are 
&gt; present - nice cores could even have some sort of library object that will do in-db 
&gt; emulation (if possible) of the requested function if it's not present... 
&gt; 
Sounds good to me. That way, what is used by more systems will become
'standard'. But who'll do it?

wrt brandon's message: Crag has become disinvolved with muds (remind you
of anyone?). He might be back, but don't quote me on that. 

and congratulations to you and Mrs Lynx-elect.
