Thanks to everyone who answered my buffer question.  I've been workign on
a curses-based windowing client and associated screen and window objects 
at run-time, but I'm having a heck of a time figuring out the core
world-0.6.  It clearly HAS an organization and logic, but I keep
stumbling over it (as an example, right now I'm trying to figure out
how to get the window object to send a buffer to the user...)

Is there a more complete and/or better documented world core out there?
I know someone mentioen one a while ago.  Documentation is particularly 
important as trying to figure out the object inheritance structure from a 
flat file is murder.

Oh, I almost forgot, my application is a FRp envrionment based on the 
Fantasy Hero system, if that slants it toward which core would be most 
useful.

Thanks
