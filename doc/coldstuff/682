I still have the assignment as expression pathch, though not in patch form.
 A server with the change made (and the operator as '=') is running on
 serial.io.com:6666 (do not spam this machine as it is a mere PC and not mine).

My vote is for &lt;- over := because &lt;- looks better to me. :)

I want to do the thing Jay said about making the parse tree available. Having
 made the assigment as exporession change I feel it is within my means to make
 a change of this type. I would make functions parrallel to the compile and
 list_method functions called something like set_ops and method_ops (please
 suggest alternatives, these do not appeal to me at all). The structure they
 would manipulate in place of the list of strings we currently use as code
 would be a method list based on the grammar of C--. It would look something
 this:

[[flags], [arg names], [var names], [statements]]

Flags would be a list of identifiers, currently 'dissallow_overrides would be
 the only one recognized.

Arg and var names would be lists of strings or idents (pick one, or don't, it 
 doesn't matter).

statements would be in the form of
[type, rest]
where rest is defined by type. Current types are 'comment, 'if, etc. The rest
 of the structure would be based on the definition of the language as found
 in grammar.y, and I will not type it all in here unless someone BEGS me to.

Does anyone have any objections? Alternative suggesions?
