Several people are developing it, although I don't know of a single 'official'
source anymore.  There is going to be a coldmudII which uses the same db format
(at least he says it will stay the same), but which is in C++ and is basically
written from scratch again (Colin/SamIAm is doing this one).  Jordan is nearly
finished with adding fork()/ etc.  Other than that there really isn't anything
left to develop.  The coldmud driver is a beautiful thing and is clean.
