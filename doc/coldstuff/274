&gt; While this list is so active, what do people think of the idea of having a
&gt;  dict_data() builtin, parallel to the dict_keys builtin? I implemented this
&gt;  on FrozenApples (when it was up) in-db by doing
&gt; 
&gt; @program $dict.data
&gt;  arg dict;
&gt;  return $list.slice($dict.to_list(dict),2);
&gt; .

Actually, it seems to me that:

@program $dict.data
 arg dict;
 var x, list;
 list = [];
 for x in (dict)
   list = list + [x[2]];
 return list;
.

...would be much more efficient, but anyway:  While I can see that this might
be nice for some uses, I can't really come up with any operation off hand that
would use it frequently enough to be a real speed issue, and I'm not sure what
other reason there would be to make a builtin specifically for this purpose..

Maybe I'm just missing some incredibly obvious need for it or something, tho..
