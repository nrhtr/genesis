&gt; &gt; Okay, I agree with Quinn, 'issuer' sounds more generic, if not, I vote

&gt; 
&gt; If you want generic, try 'initiator()'. Personally, I'd really like
&gt; something like that. There are quite a lot of times when I'd like to pin
&gt; down where  .tell() came from (usually from a room announce, from some
&gt; code on a user, started by...who? Being able to get the dbref of the
&gt; enactor would be a BIG help).

Ok, from discussions here and numerous online I'm personally narrowing it 
down to one of:

      origin()
      user()

Both of which work.  The primary bonus of 'user()' is it is short, and
should be easy to pickup by most beginning users--but it is not as
appropriate in more proffesional applications (however, it is also not
absolutely inappropriate either).  The drawback to 'origin()' is that it
doesn't imply you can change it (of course, it doesn't imply you can't
either.. ;) I'm going to be making these changes soon, of these two which
do people prefer?
