According to the mailing list archives, ice.cold.org lost most of its
webpages to a HD failure, and Brandon decided to redo them all.  A few
people complained about missing pages, but I haven't seen anything done
about it.

For what it's worth, the default HTML page (the port 1180 thing) has links
to missing pages on cold.org.

&gt; I just went through coldcore and both coldcore and genesis' README files and
&gt; identified the following URLs:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. http://www.cold.org/Software/Genesis/
&gt; 2. http://www.cold.org/Software/ColdCore/newadmin.html
&gt; 3. http://www.cold.org/~faq/cold.html
&gt; 4. http://www.cold.org/Intro/

&gt; 8. http://www.cold.org/Genesis/
&gt; 9. http://www.cold.org/ColdC/
&gt; 
&gt; As best as I can tell, the following are the current web page's analogs:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. http://web.cold.org/genesis/install.html
&gt; 2. http://web.cold.org/coldcore/newadmin.html
&gt; 3. NOT FOUND
&gt; 4. http://web.cold.org/features.html
&gt; 5. http://ice.cold.org/cold_servers/list
&gt; 6. http://web.cold.org/reference.html
&gt; 7. http://web.cold.org/contact.html
&gt; 8. http://web.cold.org/genesis/
&gt; 9. http://ice.cold.org/bin/help?node=coldc
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a process for updating and/or correcting those documents?
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, on the current webpage for coldcore, there is mention made of
&gt; "Makeworld"
&gt; My tar did not include that file, so far as I have been able to tell.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume it is logically equivalent to "bin/coldcc -tcoldcore"?
