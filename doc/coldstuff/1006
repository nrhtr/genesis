I traced a bit through the program. I discovered the following:

First, my telnet sends ^C in character mode instead of the line mode, so
^C sequence it interpreted immediately.

Secondly, connection_read got only garbage from the connection (the
sequence it actually read was 6, 255, 254, 255, 253, 6). This could be a
telnet bug.

Thirdly, this is the only situation when core gets a line that is not
terminated by CR/LF. I'm not sure this has been tested in any way.

Fourth, `[65,10,3].to_strings() =&gt; ["a",`[3]]
(can we handle buffers in these lists? Especially if it terminates by a
buffer?)

And lastly, when I kill my telnet, I get neatly disconnected, and my
connection object destroyed. So I don't think that is the problem.
