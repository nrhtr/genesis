<HR><H2>[COLD] ALPHA/STABLE releases, Mailing List Changes</H2>

I have taken the opportunity with the upcoming Genesis-STABLE release to
do a little reorganizing and finalizing how we 'do' things.  Basically,
there will be two branches to development now: STABLE and ALPHA.  These
are taken from how FreeBSD does things.  Essentially, the STABLE release
will come from the ALPHA release.  The STABLE release will never have
features added.  If there are any patches, it is only to fix critical
problems.  Any development and featurization will occur on the ALPHA
release.

To reflect these changes, and also finalize patch submission since it
wasn't too clear before, I have also updated the mailing lists:

genesis         Discussion in relation to the Genesis STABLE Release,
                bug reports and fixes for the STABLE release are reported
                to this list. 
genesis-p       STABLE Patch submission address, all patches for the
                STABLE release should be sent to this address (anybody
                can submit a patch). 
genesis-dev     Development list for Genesis ALPHA releases. Development
                notes, Patches and Bug-Reports go to this list. 
genesis-dev-p   Genesis ALPHA Patch submission address, all formal patches
                for the ALPHA release should be sent to this address
                (periodically informal patches may float across the
                ALPHA Development list). 
coldcore        Discussion in relation to the ColdCore STABLE Release, bug
                reports and fixes for the STABLE release are reported to
                this list. 
coldcore-dev    Development list for ColdCore ALPHA releases. Development
                notes, Patches and Bug-Reports go to this list. 

Any patches for Genesis should be sent to the appropriate -p lists. 
Coldcore is a different beast all-together, and maintains its own change
submission mechansism on the Cold Dark.  Any patches sent anywhere else
are irrelevant.  Periodically my RL gets very busy (such as recently, with
the anticipated 'first-born' soon and the new house I just bought), so at
times the ONLY PLACE I will be monitoring is -p.. anything else will be
ignored.

Also, ANYBODY can submit patches.  Just explain what they are, and why.
If they have been discussed with some of the core Development members and
agree'd upon its ok.  If not, swing by and chat with us first--often times
we may already have a foundation and plans for many features.

This week we are performing a final shakedown of the driver, with purify
and all other warnings and alerts.  Pending no extreme problems we should
see a Genesis 1.1-STABLE release, and development will begin on Genesis
2.0 (ALPHA)

Also for note, it looks like we may have a slick scheme for true
multi-threading without impacting the language too much.  more later..
