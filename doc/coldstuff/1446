Anyone know the status of coldhell?  I found it a few days ago and
started tinkering with it.  Don't know if it's available for public use
or if it just at cold.org as a repository.

Anyone else working with it?  I've had to make a couple of minor changes
if anyone needs them -- nothing really important  The lib seems fairly
easy to work with and I'm sure it can be adapted to other games.  There
is no license information so I don't know what restrictions the coldhell
group wants to put on the lib.

I've got a copy of the lib running at blackrabbit.mudservices.com 1150.
Come and look at it if you want.
