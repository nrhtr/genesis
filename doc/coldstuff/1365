&gt; Some things I've noticed poking through the code for $located &amp;c in my 
&gt; ColdCore 3.0a9.02 db:
&gt; 
&gt; $location.add_to_contents() - seems to be an outdated method, does this 
&gt; get called by anything?

It looks outdated to me.  It doesn't appear to be called anywhere.

&gt; $located.realm() - Gives: "Object variable realm not found", probably not 
&gt; a useful method anyway.

I fixed this a while back on the Cold Dark (drop by!).

public method $located.realm() {
    return .location().realm();
};

&gt; $located.uninit_guest_guest() - looks suspicious to me, maybe it's legit.

Hmm, I don't see that method over on the Cold Dark, so no clue.

&gt; $located,obvious - used by .set_obvious(), but ignored by .is_obvious_to()

As far as I know, the whole concept of what is visible and what is 
obvious and lighting conditions is something that is sort of being worked 
on and further developed.  This probably relates to that unfinished state.

&gt; This is a very funny piece of code:
&gt; @program $located.environment() +access=pub
&gt;   return [this()] + location.environment().setremove(this());
&gt; 

Two guesses:  something might want this() to be at the front of the 
list?  or perhaps it can't be assured that this() will be in the list 
returned by location.environment() although I can't think of any good 
reason why that should happen.
