&gt;It'd be nice if cold supported floating point, even if only as a compile-time
&gt;option. As I understand, it has this capability, but it is unimplemented.

Yes that would be nice... waitaminnit.. if it's unimplemented, how can it be considered a
'capability' ?

&gt;It would be nice if we had someone who would take charge and make all the
&gt;changes we all agree upon. Someone who everyone agreed upon, who was
&gt;wel familiar with coldmud and C, and who had the time and energy. Any
&gt;volunteers?

Heh.  the two main problems seem to be 1) getting everyone to agree on what changes to be
made and 2) getting someone to maintain and coordinate the entire effort.

What do people think of some sort of option config file for cold?  This would be a way
to enable/disable 'features' that are 'nonstandard'.  Features like floating point, 
suspend/resume, etc..  Setting these up in your config file would, perhaps, add some
particular symbols to $sys or something so objects can check to see if these features are 
present - nice cores could even have some sort of library object that will do in-db 
emulation (if possible) of the requested function if it's not present... 

YMMV.
