&gt; Add /* */. It doesn't break anything to add it, and it is consistant with
&gt;  traditional C.
&gt; 
The only consideration is nesting of block quotes.  If I remember correctly, 
(yeah, right) the C standard does NOT allow nested /**/.

&gt; It is also extremely easy to add to the language. Only question is how to
&gt;  unparse. Should all comments be unparsed as /* or // or whatever they
&gt;  were to begin with?
&gt; 
Looking at your parse tree spec, it would apear that a 'block_comment 
statement could be added without conflicting with 'comment.  I think this 
would be the best option

&gt; I vote for it to be an option of unparseing all as one or the other.
I could live with this also.

&gt; (I would be totally opposed to removing // as a line break terminated 
comment.)
Agreed
