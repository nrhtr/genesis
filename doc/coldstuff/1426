Good day Matt,

The info on those pages was lost in a hard drive crash.  The entire web
site is undergoing a redesign and all of the content is getting refreshed.

I am handling the portions specific to Genesis and the generic portions
and am hoping to find someone still who is interested in working on the
content specific to ColdCore.  I hope to have the new website completed 
and launched within 2 weeks.
 
Thanks for the reminder,
 
 - Bruce

&gt; I was just browsing the cold web pages and I noticed that the page
&gt; http://www.cold.org/~faq/ is missing and is referenced in many
&gt; places.  This is just to let someone know incase it has not been
&gt; pointed out yet.
&gt; -Matt
