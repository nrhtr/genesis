It has been said that having assignments be expressions will not affect those
 who do not wish to use them this way, but I beg to differ.

Just as Geust@Lambda.

I don't think the point was half as much to enforce a style as to prevent an
 error, specifically the miss-typing of == as = causing masive dammage.

Anyway...

My own preference would be to make the expressions. Cold is case-sensitive, so
 how much can it care what a good typer I am? :)

I still belive the change should be made and released under a different name.
