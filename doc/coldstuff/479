&gt; &lt; Jordan Baker has made changes to the server source which provide the
&gt; &lt; following:
&gt; 
&gt; But, where is it/he?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt; callers() : Returns a list of [this, definer, method, line] from the call
&gt; &lt;            call stack. Intended primarily for debugging uses.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this was generally decided to be a bad idea...?
&gt; 
&gt; 

He is on the net sometimes, and not on this list and I have to forward
 stuff I think he cares about to him. (jbb@homer.ncm.com)

It is being debugged by him. It works. It does not have the bugs you
 (Brandon) reported. The version you have was older and _alpha_.

I begged for callers() because I wanted to use it in an in-db throw which
 would suspend the eroneous task and notify the debugging programmer about
 the suspended, broken task. This could be extended into something almost
 gdb-like. Just don't use the information as part of the design of a finished
 object.
