&lt; we are trying to set up coldmud and are having some
&lt; difficulties.  We cant create a world either, although
&lt; coldmud compiled and seems to be running correctly, we
&lt; can't connect to it.  The name of the world we are tring
&lt; to create is somehting Glacier (The brain does not work
&lt; as well as it use to) Nevertheless, if there is any help
&lt; for me, it is all appreciated.

It depends upon the driver you are using, and the core.  If you are using
the Glacier world, it will only work with the very old driver 0.10-* (without
making changes that is).

If you want to use one of the newer versions (or even the ColdX driver),
you probably need either the Frozenapples core or the Cold Dark Core.

I havn't done any work in the past few months on either ColdX (my driver
hacks), or the Cold Dark.  However, there will be one more (clean) release
of both the Cold Dark Core (including all of the existing projects completed,
which encompases hypertext help, Cold text (in-db dynamic text scheme), mail,
new parsing system and new command syntax (i.e. "@display &lt;string&gt; on &lt;user&gt;"),
as well as other things I have forgotten (oh, ColdX has a signal handler)).

You can try to catch me online at the Cold Dark (good luck, I'm rather busy
as of late, RL sucks ;), which is at:
