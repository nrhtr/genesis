Frobs as things was an experiment that lived its life and from the
result of it I can say with much assurety that you do not want to do
it.  It is just too painfull without much gain.  While there are still
relics of the expirement around (wearable frobs), you dont want to use
them.  Objects in cold are plenty lightweight.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt;     I'm wanting to code some DIKU MUD-like qualities into the core such as

of
&gt; a "template" in the VR. A good example of what I'm babbling about is the
&gt; wearable frob.
&gt;     While I pseudo-understand how the wearable frob works, I don't grasp =
how
&gt; to programmatically handle frobs in the VR... doing things like
&gt; accessing/manipulating object variables, listing current frobs in the VR,=
 or
&gt; targeting them for manipulation/destruction. Can anyone give me some
&gt; pointers or examples on doing this? Major domo on all the support so far,
&gt; folks. You know who you are.
