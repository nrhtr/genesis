Mostly, i wasnt real clear on how params worked when i thought
of the accessor bit, so i thought you had to do a setvar if
you wanted to change a param...
the reason I wanted to have an accessor was for abstraction purposes..
having only one method that directly set a parameter, with all other 
methods calling the accessor to change or read the value, so that 
changes could be made to how that parameter was set (or returned)
easily, but It's probably not worth the overhead to always do this,
just make the method if its necessary, i guess. Its easy to be a 
purist when your being abstract, and not considering db bloat or
speed :)
