&lt; a valid reason for not changing it: you have to rewrite all existing code.
&lt; trivial but annoying. 

I thought of this, and 1 unix command would suffice (from a valid textdump):

sed "s/ = / := /g" textdump &gt; textdump.out

(although it would mess up any text you had with ' = ' in it).

&lt; even more trivial: its an extra character ;)

Damn, I didn't think of that 8)

&lt; I don't see arguments about difficulty of grasping the concept of
&lt; assignment vs test of equality as particularly reasonable. That would
&lt; be like changing english "no" to something else just because japanese
&lt; "no" means something different. explain the concept of assignment,
&lt; explain the concept of test for equality, then explain the sybols for
&lt; these operations.

It isn't the concept of assignment versus test of equality that people
get hung up on, it is just simple confusion of a single equals sign with
a double equals sign.  (Do keep in mind: even though you may not see many
people experiencing this problem, it still is a problem.  Ask yourself how
much time you spend helping 'newbies' (the more time you have spent the
more aware to this actual circumstance you would be)).
