Ok, I fixed the problem with the missing README (tweaked it a touch for the
changes since it was last written).  I also added a little more to configure
in lieu of what is in the README file.  I didn't include case checking for
all of the situations it covered as that would require adding #ifdefs, which
Greg didn't want.

0.12-1b/src is actually Jordan's source (last mod date on the file was
Oct 30), with Alex Stewart's fixes and my tweak of write_log/write_err,
going to stdout and stderr appropriately.

The .texi file in doc/ is only for server 0.11 (it doesn't include
information on anything Jordan has added).  The CHANGES file is updated
a touch, although I am somewhat unclear as to what occured from 0.10 -&gt; 0.12,
so feel free to change/mod things.

it is at:
