Just a  short note.  I had a brainstorm last night and have started 
something that I think alot of folk will find really cool and useful 
for multi-developer cores (its a combination core-debugger and source 
code control system that runs from inside of my core and talks to a 
java based GUI) .  I wanted to make sure of something, 
though.  

Brandon in his last notes says something about removing the 
ColdCC functionality from genesis.  I just wanted to make sure that 
the object manipulation funtions, including compile and decompile, 
would remain.  I need them for my project and it woudl in general be 
very difficult to implement most classic forms of Muds without them.
