&gt; Sure.  I don't care about the syntax and ?= is better than unless,
&gt; and I want' suggesting that a different syntax be used.  I wanted
&gt; to know if the 'if' test implicit in ?= was on the existing value
&gt; of the variable or if it was a test for wether or not a value had
&gt; been assigned to the variable.
&gt; 
&gt; It may be the case that it really doesn't matter which property of
&gt; a variable you test (its value, or its settedness).  In which case
&gt; fine.

Ahhh--it is a boolean test on the value of the data, as even 'unset'
variables are technically set to zero--there is no system in the driver
for determining unset vs set (everything begins as '0').

So:

  foo = "";

  foo ?= "bar";

Would result in foo being assigned "bar".
