My reason aginst: I don't see a need, the cost is the work of adding it plus
 the possibility of adding it in a way which causes more bugs or something.

I do NOT see this as a hole. It is something that is easily fixed in-db IF you
 even care at all. I don't see it as a problem in the first place.

If I saw it as a problem I would have written the in-db solution by now.

Crag/Robert, not fixing it if it ain't broke.

P.S. If you want this change so bad, make it and post the patch.
