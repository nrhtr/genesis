I vote for client(), since it's short, and since the client is typically 
the end making the request, it seems appropriate to me.

&gt; Ok, it sounds like the general concept is accepted (assuming this since 
&gt; everybody I talked to and those on the list instantly jumped to syntax :)
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly I would rather use 'user()' because it is short, it is not always 
&gt; conceptually correct--which is also a large drawback for me.  The two goals
&gt; I have with naming it are: ease of use (I really dont like long function 
&gt; names in high-use positions) and appropriateness.  Since I plan on 
&gt; evolving ColdC more and more to handle more tasks, I'd like to keep 
&gt; appropriateness in mind.  Anybody have a thesarus?  :)  Suggestions on 
&gt; the table:
&gt; 
&gt;      controller()      -- most appropriate, too bulky and long
&gt;      server()
&gt;      con()
&gt;      user()
&gt;      requestor()
&gt;      client()
&gt; 
&gt; (I forget any others...)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm actually liking 'client()' or 'server()' (both are appropriate, 
&gt; depending upon the point of view you are taking).
