A friend of mine recently told me about the ColdMUD server, and
I am trying to find out more about the current development status.
(Namely, I compiled and tested it on my Linux box, and have run
into what appear to be bugs.  (It dies on regression test #6 with 
a segmentation error, for instance.))  I am hesistant to start
digging through the code and trying to fix things if they have
already been fixed.  :)  I am currently (attempting to) build a
database.

The server looks like a very nice piece of design so far, though.

(Hopefully, I have managed to get on this list as well, and this list
is the right spot for this discussion.)
