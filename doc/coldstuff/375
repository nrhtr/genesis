I did in fact request that the routines which manipulate the object lookup
 table refer to the lookup keys as names. That is, I prefer add_objname to
 set_name. In the current docs, $foo is a name expression which evaluates
 identically to get_name('foo). $foo therefore, is not really a dbref, since
 it has the name layer between 'foo and the actual number of the object.

I think it's less confusing to call "$root" a name and "#1" a number. Hence
 Brandon's suggestions as orriginally mailed.

Naturally, the change from set_name() to add_objname() is to account for the
 fact that objects are allowed to have multiple names.

My thanks to Greg for the name/num setup. It makes swapping objects out for
 debug purposes and such easy and just plain makes sense.
