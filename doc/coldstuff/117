do:

  ./coldmud ./world &gt;&gt;&amp; logfile &amp;

didn't work.  but ./coldmud ./world &gt;&amp; logfile &amp;  did.


&gt; Created new room $room3.
&gt; ERROR: $exit.spawn called with three arguments, requires one.
&gt; Thrown by interpreter opcode MESSAGE.
&gt; ~numargs in $nowhere.make_exit (defined on $room), line 8
&gt; ~methoderr in $programmer1.dig_to_cmd (defined on $builder), line 10

&gt;hee, this is because greg changed the way .init worked in world 4.0 from 3.0,
&gt;but he forgot to change it on exits.  Just change the init to be:

&gt;pass();
&gt;if (!inited) {
&gt;  &lt;what it sets&gt;
&gt;  inited = 1;
&gt;}

then:

;$exits.add_parameter('inited);

and it should work.


I'm a bit confused.  I corrected the first part, but is the second
supposed to go in textdump or be typed in by me on coldmud?
I tried typing it in, and got an error. 


&gt;Chaos will be releasing his core soon, and i'll be merging it into the Cold
&gt;Dark.  Other than that i'm not sure if anybody is working on anything...

Well, anyone who wants to contribute to a single 'definative more then the
basics core' please let me know.  Bare core is good, but like Lambdacore,
most systems want at least the basics built already.


&gt;&gt; I'm willing to create a manual for coding (since I'll be learning it at the
&gt;&gt; same time, should be a good beginner's intro by the time I get done.) so
&gt;&gt; I'm looking for as much solid stuff to build a good core as I can get.
&gt;Did you see Greg's Manual?

You talking about coldmud.info or the postscript stuff?  I haven't looked
at the ps stuff yet.
