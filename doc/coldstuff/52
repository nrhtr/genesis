&gt; TO the folks at colddark... i just tried to log in... as guest... but
&gt; couldn't... got some odd error...

Sorry, I was/am in the process of chparenting $player to where $person was, and
moving $person to where player was, and changning the name of $player to $user,
and adding $player after $person (made some decisions already :)

-Lynx/Brandon/Me.

BTW, you can use 'create' at the motd, I just took it out of the motd so that I
wouldnt have a bunch of people who want to stop by and browse getting
$programmer type characters and then having them collect dust...
