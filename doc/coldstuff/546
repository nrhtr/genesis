&lt; In general, I would rather see nothing done to the server, 
&lt; than see a bunch of ill considered hacks thrown into the server,
&lt; in the name of I don't know... Progress?  Convenience?
&lt; Notional improvement?

Unfortunately (fortunately?), everybody does not share the same position
as you on what is 'good' for the driver.  While it seems like you have
some holy vision of how the server should be, others also have opinions.
Just because you do not like their opinions does not mean they are wrong,
it means YOU dont like their opinions.  This whole attitude which people
seem to have in regard to driver development that "my ideas are right,
because I was touched by God and know the truth, anything you come up
with is wrong, period, and I don't care what your reasons are" is sheer
stupidity.

Speaking from the experience of administrating the development of NetrekII
since it's infancy (NetrekII development consists of a team of ~10 developers
and ~30k lines of client code and ~40k lines of server code) I feel I can
safely say that EVERYBODY has an opinion in where something is going.  If
it just happens that 9 out of 10 people on the 'development team' decide
they like something, IT DOESNT MATTER if you think the change is selling
the soul of the code, what matters is that you are a minority.  Realize that
in respect to that change your idea will not find ground.  Deal with it
and learn to work as a team--your ideas may be holy and touched by God,
but as far as anybody else is concerned so are their ideas.  Try to give a
little ground sometime.

As far as Richelieu doing development on the driver, I plan on helping him
in this endeavor--even IF I do not like some of the changes he may make.  I
have already taken the 0.10 source filetree (with the test directory and
documentation) and updated it to 0.12, written a base configure script and
revamped the makefiles.  (amoung other changes).

&lt; I trust him not to pollute coldmud with poisoned confectionary 
&lt; like do {abomination} while {abominable}.

goto: first and second paragraph

Most people want this change (infact, you are the only person I know who
finds it an abomination, most people do not care either way or want it).

[snip]
&lt; All you really need is a place to ftp the latest server(s) from [...]

Sticky.usu.edu is open to anything (space is readily available there), and
I have done my best to make distinctions between the different sources,
documentation, cores, textdumps and other paraphenilia.

[snip]
&lt; Certainly, also, Chaos and Crag would be a moderating interface
&lt; between Richelieu and I, to the extent that I might want to
&lt; make my position/feelings felt on some issues.

(sigh, feel's pity for Chaos and Crag)

Colin: please pay attention to headers in a message that indicate the
difference between a change Richelieu is going to make, and one which he
is requesting discussion on.
