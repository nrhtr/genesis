I think the 1.1.8 release (which never seemed to have been announced) fixed
that.

Brandon?

&gt;
&gt;I found that on my mandrake linux, I had to be sure perl5
&gt;was installed, because it had the ndbm.h header file I needed.
&gt;
&gt;That header file ended up in /usr/include/db1
&gt;I guessed it would be needed in /usr/include as well, so
&gt;copied it into there as well.  Yes, I know, a link would probably
&gt;have been wiser, but I didn't.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, that solved my problem and genesis compiled
&gt;fine after that.
