Ok, with the help of Jeff Kesselman I've got the textdump split into
each of it's relative files.  I also added in the command_environment
which sped up parsing a bit (you do not notice the time used in parsing
when there are low users and not many commands, but it soon becomes
an issue).  This one is also much cleaner.  I don't think there will
be another release until 2.0, which will include ctext and hypertext
help (not the same as QV's, I wasn't happy with that design--wanted more
flexibility).
