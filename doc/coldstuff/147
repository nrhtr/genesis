I have to apologize for disappearing suddenly, but my life has become
very hectic very quickly.

I'm currently dealing with a lot of classwork and a personal life
that's taking up a lot more of my time, and on top of that, I'm trying
to single-handedly save MIT's network services from a rapidly
expanding load due to the addition of the residential networks.  I
don't have any time at all for frivolous pursuits such as muds.

I'm still very interested in coldmud, and plan to get back to it when
I have time.  I plan to rewrite the server as a multithreaded C++
program and introduce some other innovations; I think I may also be
able to solve some of the needling core design issues, but this will
all be later.
