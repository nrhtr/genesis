In fact there is already an archive of ColdMUD sources here, being maintained
by Greg Hudson himself. Perhaps he would like to relinquish control over the
archive before we start jumping in on top of it.

Also, since Jay mentioned it, please keep in mind a logical distinction
between ftp.ccs.neu.edu and ftp.mud.org. The latter is not an officially
supported name as yet, and although these both currently point to the same
machine, this is likely to change in the near future.

For now the official address should be ftp.ccs.neu.edu.
