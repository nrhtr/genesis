&lt;&gt;    bind()        -- it doesn't work for more than 1 port
&lt;
&lt; Could you be more elaborate about this?  Are you passing in the 'more
&lt; than one part' as arguments to a single bind call (which is
&lt; incorrect), or doing several bind() calls?  If you're doing the
&lt; latter, what do you mean by "it doesn't work"?

Sorry, I could have sworn I spoke about this once already.  Ok, from the
manual:

bind(port, receiver)

[stuff]

I created a method on $sys called bind:

@program $sys.bind
 arg port, obj;

 if (caller() != $net)
   throw(~perm, "Sender is not $net.");
 (&gt; bind(port, obj) &lt;);
.

Called by $network (obviously).  $net.bind:

@program $net.bind
 arg port;

 .perms(sender(), 'system);
 $sys.bind(port, this());
.

Now, I eval $net.bind(12345) and receive:

! =&gt; Couldn't bind to port 12345.
!    Thrown by function bind().
!    ~bind: 0.bind (0) line: 5
!    ~bind: $net.bind ($net) line: 4
!    ~methoderr: $lynx.tmp_eval ($lynx) line: 5
!    ~methoderr: $lynx.eval ($root) line: 16

Basically, I have tried all sorts of variations and different
objects/ports/etc.  None work, and as far as I know none are being used
currently.  Since it DOES obviously bind to the first port, I would assume this
is just a bug where it cannot bind to any more ports after the first one (?).

(OH, and those two methods were quickies to test it out -- dont bother about
security with them).
