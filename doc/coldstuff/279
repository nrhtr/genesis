&lt; I would really like to see the services implemented as one port as this would
&lt; actually simplify access. A 'services' server would run, allowing services
&lt; to 'register' themselves as available in the db.

Ok, once again.  In the above listing that service _is_ there.  It is the
portmapper port.  However, I think that we should not do just one or the other,
but rather both.  Have a few basic "known" ports (such as login and fingerd),
and if the server wants to it can expand beyond these known ones, through the
user of portmapper.
