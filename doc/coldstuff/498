&gt; The more I think about it, the more I believe that the driver should
&gt; dump object's with their dbref rather than objnum, _if one is assigned_.

:notes this down on the list he's now keeping of things to do on the server.

BTW, all.. I should apologize to Crag (and Jordan too, somewhat) for flying off
like I did on this list..  I was frustrated and anxious about having so little
information about the state of affairs of everything and I took it out on Crag
even though he didn't have a lot to do with the way things have been going
anyway..

Anyway, what with the newer release of 0.12, and having talked a little bit
with Jordan about things, if nobody has any objections I'd be happy to take
over the role of semi-official server-worker-on and bug-yeller-at-about for
this list (and I promise I won't go off and lose my net connection or move to
Mongolia or something like that).. after being actively on the other end for a
while it seems only reasonable that I take on some of the responsibility too,
and since I'm planning on working on some of this stuff anyway..

I'll go back through the list and try to make up a list of all the stuff people
have been wanting/needing and post here with what I come up with for comments,
then (hopefully) set in about doing something about some of them soon..  If you
have your own lists out there, feel free to send them to me and I'll include
them..
