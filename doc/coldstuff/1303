Here's a strange behavior: mudservices recently crashed and since
it was brought back up I haven't been able to stay connected for
more than five minutes.  I don't get kick off, but if I idle for
about 5 minutes and then try to type anything, no characters show
up (not even an echo).  The server is still running and I can
reconnect any number of times, but I always get the same behavior.
This is for ColdCore A7 and the P26 driver.

I tried shuting down the server and restarting and same behavior.
I've even copied binary.bak to binary, and the same results.

I've tried telnet connections from two versions of Linux and
a SunOS, and still the same behavior.  

Anyone know if this is possibly so "reset by peer" and I don't
see the message?  Mudservices runs several muds and if the system
in general was having the problem, then other users should have reported
it.  If anyone has a hint about what the possible problem may be, let me
know at frankc@maddog.com, or come to blackrabbit.mudservices.com 1138
amd see for yourself.  Of course if you dont have a problem, I would
like to know that too.  

Frank
