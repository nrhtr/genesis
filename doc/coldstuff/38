&gt; I dunno how Cold does it; from the remarks Greg has made it I'm
&gt; guessing that properties (data members, slots, whatever you want to
&gt; call them) aren't inherited at all except at creation time, which
&gt; means that it's like MOO before it had clear properties.  I
&gt; guess you can simulate clear properties with methods that lookup the
&gt; parent tree manually if the property is equal to a certain
&gt; out-of-band value (e.g.  'clear), but it seems like it would be
&gt; nicer if there were some in-server way of doing this.

Variable values are not inherited in Coldmud, period.  All object
variables have a default value of 0.

I do not think it would be "nicer" to have a more baroque variable
lookup system, notwithstanding people's reliance on it in MOO.  As I
pointed out, such a variable lookup system damages encapsulation, and
can be done trivially in-db.
