&gt;	ANSI codes are not a solution, no matter what the PC BBS
&gt; community may think of them.  I would guess that less than half the
&gt; people on a random mud have ANSI color display capabilites on their
&gt; terminals.  If you want to give the server the capability of attaching
&gt; extra information to the text it's sending, do it in a broad spectrum,
&gt; general way, NOT by hacking in something display-specific, and limited
&gt; like vt100/ansi escape codes.

Really?

Look we are getting nowhere, is anybody, or does anybody know of anybody
working on a standard for this type of thing?  Is there one out there?  We can
debate it to the groud but as this previous article shows we will run in
circles saying the exact same thing as was said before...
