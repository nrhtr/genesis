Robert de Forest drew these heiroglyphs:
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to propose '-&gt;' be the assignment operator. It visually represents
&gt;  what happens to the variable being assigned the new value. It has no chance
&gt;  of being pronounced, 'equals'. It looks cool...

it's backwards.  :) 

though that's been discussed.  What concerns me is that '=' is already
assignment.  do we really want two different assignment operators?  or
are we removing the single '=' entirely?  If so, all I'd do is write
code in-db that changed them back and forth like JHcore MOOs do with
comments.  which makes the whole issue of what to call it quite
academic, actually.  but it's not feasable to write code in-db that
does assignment-as-expression, so let's have it in the server.

&gt; What have I left out?

how about index-as-lvalue?  (foo[bar] = 1; foo[bar..baz] = [1, 2, 3])
