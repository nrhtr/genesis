This is more of a feature release, Major Changes:

   * $string.html_escape added, does the minimal necessary escapes.
   * new functions listidx() and bufidx() (to go along stridx())
   * genesis can setuid to another user now (-g and -u options)
   * genesis can prebind network ports, if running as root (so that
     later after an suid it can use them).  Use the -p option, formatted
     as [ADDR]:PORT.  UDP ports are specified as with bind_port() by
     specifying a negative port number. ADDR must be a valid IP
     address--not a domain name.

Minor Changes:

   * The third argument to list_method() now is a bitfield, see:
     http://www.cold.org:1180/bin/help?node=help_func_list_method
   * updated configure scripts to handle newer OS's
   * if the driver dies at startup it'll print to both errlog and stderr
   * Redid all genesis arguments to allow for easier expanding.
     Full list is (as always) available with genesis -h.
   * Bugfixes: objects were not dirtied when the objname was changed;
     `[buf] in `[buf] would fail sometimes; fchmod() would get its
     args confused.
   * Made the path argument to fremove() required.
   * Any 'stat' info returned from a file function will now format the
     file mode as an octal number in a string
   * a touch more cleanup with Win32 and Win32 docs (Jon Lambert)

As always, it is available at:

    ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/drivers/Genesis.tar.gz

There is a patch as well.
