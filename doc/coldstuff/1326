I think someone already has code for this but---

I'm looking for a way to separate people based on how
they log in so that certain people will go to certain realms.
This means that I don't want everyone to login and be at the pit.
I had considered having different ports for different users or
a menu where a person can select a realm.  Any suggestions?

Actually this is two problems.  First is the "login to different realms"
and the second is handling sleeping bodies.  If people change their
home, then they show as sleeping bodies when they disconnect.  I would
rather than the housekeeper grab then and then on login they are
restored.  Or --the mush style-- is to have them dark.
