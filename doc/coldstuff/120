#
#&gt;I'm looking to create a core that is more accessable to the TinyMUD
#&gt; family people out there, because that's one way to attract them.
#
#What does that mean `accessable to the TinyMUD family'?  Isn't that
# taking a step backwards?  After MOO, tinymuds seem so awkward and
# primitive to me.

Not at all.  There's a large customer base using TinyMud-like servers.
Ah, if only designers of muds would think of them instead of how nifty
and complicated their server can be...

Anyway.  I run a tinymud-like server with a db of 17k objects, and my
interset in Cold was that I could somehow convert the db over.  But this
would require at a minimum that the tinymud commands are still available.
You can have OO in and out your ass three ways past Wednesday, but I
still want a server with @dig, @link, @find, @open... I can't tell yet
whether this will be doable in Cold, but as TeenyMud 2.0 looks like it
will never be released, I'm hoping to find alternatives.  It'd be a
damn shame to toss a 17k object db.
