Actually, I just realized that I said that discussing core issues here was ok,
but I also realize that I'm not the one to determine that type of thing..  It
has been my impression, however, that core issues aren't forbidden here, tho,
particularly if they relate to larger language issues (as Ash's
questions/suggestions did)..

Comments Greg?

BTW, core issues are freely discussed (and even worked on!) on the ColdDark all
the time..  That is, in fact, our primary purpose, at the moment, so people
should drop by if interested..
