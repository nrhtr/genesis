MUDEDIT is up for public browsing as I now have guest login working.
use the button labeled "MUDEDIT remote."

I apologize that the code you will be browsing is pre 1.0 ColdX.  
Conversion is my next task.

As a guest you will not be able to recompile or add/delete methods or 
parameters, but you will be able to browse the mud objects and see 
how the  interface works.  (HINT:  It works slickest and fastest 
under the new Netscape, Atlas release BUT Atlas for Unix appears 
broken so you can only use the Windows atlas to run Mudedit.  
Otherwise any properly JAVA compliant browser should work just fine.)

If for any reason login fails, it means the actual mud is down.  Mail 
me and Ill re-start it (its on a development machien that goes down 
from time to time.)

The MUDEDIT code is available off the page.  Please feel free to grab 
a copy for your own use.  The supporting MUD code in my 
implementation is in the edit_connection object.  edit_connection 
requires a small amount of specific support that is in my sys and 
root objects.  Its shoudl be pretty easy to follow...
