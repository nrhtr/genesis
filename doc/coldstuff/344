&gt; While server-based floating point support would be far faster, it would not
&gt;  be exceedingly difficult to code floating point in-db. This seems to me
&gt;  to be a nicer solution from a server development perspective. Besides,
&gt;  I doubt very much that ColdMUD would be fast enough to be useful as a
&gt;  simulation language. I think you'd be better off writing your simulation
&gt;  in C or C++ and using someone's libraries.

Actually, there is already a Space Simulation running on Micromuse based apon
10 second updates(ships move every 10 secs) with almost 100 'objects' floating
around in space currently that is a hybrid of C(in server) and MUSE code(online)to act as an interface. The C portion of the code currently runs in under one
second every update. I believe Coldmud due to its unique nature would be able
to handle 10 second updates although of course it'd have to been seen to be
known.

Question: Is the C-- code 'compiled' or interpreted during 'runtime'?
