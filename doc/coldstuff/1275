Hi,

Now that I have my Cold world running (blackrabbit.mudservices.com 1138)
it's really depressing without people or moving gizmos.  So naturally
I'm wondering where I can find gizmos that I can adapt for my environment.
Some moving gizmos include elavators, shuttles, escalators and things
like that.  I also wonder if anyone has some mobile NPCs that they would
be willing to share.  Essentially I'm looking for a 'contribute' section--
I'm willing to provide the ftp space if that will help.

Also does anyone have a nice short tutorial on how to build $robot things?
Finally, I'm back to the same question as before, how to do event-type
things.  For example, in a hack-and-slash mud there is a heartbeat
and some event loop that deals with fighting, healing, recovering from poisons,
etc, etc.  As a minimum I would like a Cold world that can be as "alive"
as at least a Diku MUD or better yet, Neil's Ogham mud.

Anyone else interested in moving gizmos?

Frank
