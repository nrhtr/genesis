While server-based floating point support would be far faster, it would not
 be exceedingly difficult to code floating point in-db. This seems to me
 to be a nicer solution from a server development perspective. Besides,
 I doubt very much that ColdMUD would be fast enough to be useful as a
 simulation language. I think you'd be better off writing your simulation
 in C or C++ and using someone's libraries.

That's my first reaction, anyway.

I have no objection to adding floating point numbers as yet another type.
