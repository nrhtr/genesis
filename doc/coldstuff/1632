Read the message.  It stated: A VARIANT OF.

Specifically since this is a no-charge situation anything relating in
any way shape or form to a charge will be removed.  The parts I
personally care about deal with acceptable use (i.e. consuming
bandwidth and resources kindly).

But thanks for pointing it out, I'll keep it in mind when I make the
actual agreement.

&gt; &gt; So it will be in some part self regulating as far as load goes.  This
&gt; &gt; community server will become glacier.cold.org, and will require a
&gt; &gt; signed acceptable use policy (a variant of:
&gt; &gt; http://www.roguetrader.com/agreement.html)
&gt; 
&gt; It's moot, of course, but I wouldn't sign an agreement like that if my very 
&gt; life depended on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Some highlights are the instantly variable charges due and payable at the 
&gt; instant of consumption variability without notice; total disclaimer for 
&gt; fitness for purpose or merchantable quality;  the non-competition clause, and 
&gt; the several absolute discretions reserved by the vendor.
&gt; 
&gt; About the best thing you could say about the agreement is that most of it's 
&gt; probably unenforceable.
