Actually, the main issue for me is two disparit sources.  We have a
version of the manual in a dynamic text format (Ctext) in the coldcore
database.  It is useful to use for reference.  If we stop using this
as the definitive source for the manual (as it has been in the past)
then we should probably completely remove it from ColdCore, so it
doesn't get out of date.  So the question is really:

    1) who would mind if the manual was _removed_ from coldcore

On a side node--what was changed in the manual?  From what I can
pickup:

    1) Mostly formatting stuff
    2) A TOC
    3) An index

Has content changed?  I would love to accept the changed content back
into ColdCore.  As for the formatting things, what sortof formatting
things is it?  Bold/italics etc can also be put into ColdCore.  And as
I mentioned earlier, the formatter could be made to generate a TOC and
index...
