I have build some pages for ColdMUD on the web.  They are just generic
information pages about coldmud, what it's current status is, etc.  (I did it
because there wasn't a page for coldmud, other than the manual, and I felt it
would be nice to have a central document pointing to everything I could find
involving ColdMUD).  Because a lot of servers have stated their 'private'
status, I have not included them on the list of servers.  However, I would like
to get more servers on that list.  If you admin a server and want to get on,
just leave me a comment on those pages.

Also, there is also a page on Core's being developed for coldmud, I will flesh
out any aspect of this page, and even add specific pages on any core's being
developed (currently I just have a page for the cold dark).

The top level URL is:

     http://www.usu.edu/~brandon/ColdMUD

I am currently rewriting the manual to boost the level of 'hypertextness' (I
will also provide a concatenated version), it is not finished.  In other
ramblings about the pages the ColdMUD logo only took a few seconds to create. 
If anybody wants they can send me another one (or eventually I will get around
to doing a nicer one).
