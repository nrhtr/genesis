Spake Crag:
&gt;  will be releasing my change to his ColdX server. Based on these grounds I
&gt;  think arguments based on 'C-- should be like C' are moot...or something. I
&gt;  don't think we should restrict ourselves this way.
&gt; 
&gt; A language 'Joule' I read about (which has no implementation yet, as far as
[etc]
&gt; The point is, there is no assignment operator at all in this new language. Of

As you just proved, Joule is designed completely different than ColdC.
Think of it like a pile of jello (can I say that on tv?). If you squish
around the bottom part too much, it'll all come crashing down and you'll
have to rebuild from all the globules which probably have dirt from the
floor on them; or you could buy another pack and think it over.

I don't object to changing small things, really. Nor do I object to starting
over with a new jello mix (as it were). I do object to trying to make
changes in the foundation and try to pretend it's the same thing, because
that could get messy. (at least, I THINK that's the point. you know,
some analogies just get out of control.)

&gt; All this rambling is to add weight to my assertion that '&lt;-' is the best
&gt;  best operator to use for assignment in the ColdX server. Its meaning agrees
&gt;  fairly well with its visual structure. It does not in any way appear to be
&gt;  a comparison. It suggests modification (through motion).

I don't see any reason to change from '='. There may be confusion with
'=='. By the same token, there may be confusion between '&lt;-' and '-' or '&lt;'.
I think the least confusion would be in remaining consistent.

&gt;"It's too different" - ColdX itself is very different. To keep '=' or change to


Well, if you want it to be different, that's another story.

Paul,
who's hoping his editor didn't insert text the way it placed the cursor
