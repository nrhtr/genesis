I have started working with the minimal database since ColdCore is so
big and under-documented and does _much_ more than I need. Also just for
the experience of building up from almost nothing. Not that the minimal
DB doesn't take a bit of study to fully understand since it does so much
of the basic magic, or perhaps because I'm just dense... Anyhow I
uncovered a couple of things I'd like to point out since they caused me
a bit of trouble tracking them down:

In $root.spawn() second to last line 
==&gt;     (&gt; set_objname(name) &lt;) 
changes the name of the PARENT not the child! 
==&gt;     (&gt; obj.set_objname(name) &lt;)
seems to do the trick


In $connection_interface.match_command() : 
==&gt;    match = ((commands[c])[1]).match_template(line);
appears to be using the input line as the template, reversing them helps
==&gt;    match = line.match_template((commands[c])[1]);
        

Maybe no one is using the Minimal but if they do hopefully this will
save them some bug-chasing.
