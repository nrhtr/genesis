Good day,

In the 1.1p6 release of Genesis, there is a change to fix a bug that will
affect most running systems out there today.  The $dictionary.union() native
was handling its args in reverse order.  This made it operate differently
from $list.union(), union() (for lists), and dict_union().

Example:

$dictionary.union():
;#[[1, 2], [3, 4]].union(#[[3, 5], [4, 6]]);
=&gt; #[[3, 4], [4, 6], [1, 2]]
[ seconds: 0.000087; operations: 22 ]

dict_union():
;dict_union(#[[1, 2], [3, 4]], #[[3, 5], [4, 6]]);
=&gt; #[[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 6]]
[ seconds: 0.000068; operations: 22 ]

This is not cause for panic.  The calls to $dictionary.union() in a core
should be relatively easy to locate and correct.  Note that this must be
done in concert with the driver upgrade to maintain proper behavior.

Will the ColdCore people be able to put out a snapshot of ColdCore that has
these things fixed?  Also, for those whose cores diverged over time, it
might be useful to see a list of the places in ColdCore that had to be
fixed.

The 1.1p6 release will also contain some bugfixes accidentally left out of
1.1p5, a fix for the new bufidx() bug in 1.1p5, a lot of work on the Win32
port, along with some more bugfixes.  If anyone has any problems that they
have not reported, this would be a great time to report them as we near the
release of 1.1p6 (about 3-4 weeks from now).

Discussion of Genesis develop will start occuring more on the Genesis list,
genesis@cold.org.

Thanks!

 - Bruce
