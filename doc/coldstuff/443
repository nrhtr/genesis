Original quote by Colin McCormack:

&gt; It strikes me that one of C--'s features is its similarity to C++.

&gt; Hence, assignment `=' (should be an expression)
&gt;        equality `==' (if you can't tell the difference, learn to program)
&gt;        while (abomination) { abomination } (abomination) - syntax sucks rocks.

If nothing else, I share the same attitude.  It doesn't quite make sense
to take a language called C-- and make it like pascal, or worse, add a
weird conditional structure.  If anything, C-- should mimic C and C++.
The nice thing about staying inside those bounds is that C-- and ColdMud
in general have an added benefit of serving instructional purposes with
the language and environment.  It's hard as hell trying to show LPC or
worse, TinyMUSH or MUCK or MUSE code to an admin and say that what you
are doing on his machine will be instructional.  Show him you're C--
code, and he'll look over it and it's possible he'll understand it.
