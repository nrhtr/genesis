I had to laugh when I heard the phrase:

&gt; Overall I doubt it would take more than a second to sync the db
&gt; except in the rare situations.

When I hear a phrase like the one on the subject line, or like that one
quoted above, it sets off little warning bells in my head, that tells
me, "This person might not be thinking far enough in advance."

Success sometimes happens.  If you had a COLD server that serviced 350
simultenous players, had an 80 meg database (when dumped to a flat
textfile) with 160,000+ objects in it, that is doing 30,000 attribute
accesses a minute average, then I'm pretty sure the server will pause
for just a wee bit more than a second to sync.  (These numbers are from
the largest MU* I know of, just for an example.)

There aren't any COLDs that large yet, but, I think, someday there will
be.  Give it a few years.  (Previous said MU* took 5.)
 
What is the point of this babbling?  Just to remind people to think big.
After all, there are tens of millions of potential customers coming
online in the USA alone.  Out of that population base, surely it's not
that unlikely to find a few thousand who might want to use a particular
COLD.
