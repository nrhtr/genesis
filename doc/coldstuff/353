I am very confused here (like always).

The system methods $sys.do_backup() and $sys.text_dump()

----------------------------
@program $sys.do_backup
 arg who;
 var line, name, foo;

 .perms(sender(), 'system);
 $channels.announce('System, "System Backup");
 last_backup = time();
 .text_dump();
.

@program $sys.text_dump
 .perms(sender(), 'this);
 return text_dump();
.
----------------------------

The question arises around $channels.announce(), which will announce to the
'System board about the impending backup.  However, the announcement is not
arriving until _after_ the backup, rather than before.  This has been discussed
locally uncountable times, with different conclusions every time.  Therefore I
beg of Greg to answer our dilemma.

Why is the system builtin 'text_dump()' being called and executed before
$channels.announce is finished?  It makes no difference to have the line:

        foo = $channels.announce('System, "System Backup.");

What is going on?  Richelieu suspects it has to do with the way text_dump() is
run, but if text_dump() is a sub method call of .text_dump(), why is
.text_dump() getting called?  (there are more questions and speculations, but
this is enough to ask the question)...
