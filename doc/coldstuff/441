I toss my vote toward's the ':=' as an assignment operator.  It would be the
best fix...

Cons for having assignments as expressions AND having '=' as an assignment
operator:

* It gets confused with '==', quite often.

(I can't think of any others)

Pros for having assignments as expressions with '=' as an assignment operator:

* It makes certain aspects of code smaller and more compact.

Cons for having assignments as expressions with ':=' as an assignment operator:

none

Pros for the same:

* It makes certain aspects of code smaller and more compact.

OK, sample code:

while (var := .test()) {
  (expr);
}

while (var == .test()) {
  (expr);
}

I quite like it actually...

BTW, I also think we should use 'handler' alone in a catch sequence.  As riche
stated, two words for one operation is bad.  'with' on its own is vague,
'handler' isn't.  Sample code:

catch ~twink {
  foo;
} handler {
  foo;
}
