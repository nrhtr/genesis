&lt; Cool!  Guess that means I better get that patch in so I can upgrade.
&lt; Speakign of which, I have a question for everyone.

BTW, I integrated all of your changes except for the bitwise ops.  You were
missing some of the stuff required for logical grammar as well as decompiling
them.

I would suggest patching off 0.1-5 (or whatever you built off) and I can
gut what I dont need, as 6 and higher are getting very different than what
you are used to (6 moves all of the non-integral functions to a modules
subdirectory, where they are turned into libraries, in anticipation of
me adding native methods on objects).

&lt;    buffer_tail(buff,length(buff)+1);

Umm, I dunno, it should throw a range error, no?  You are asking for something
out of range.  Otherwise, sublist([1,2,3], 5) should also return []...

&lt; BTW: What do these do? Obviously they are methods on D, I'm just curious.

Umm, it sets the connection object as active, and give's it the host. (grin).
