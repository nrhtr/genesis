&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Ive been playign with the windows port.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; First problem is that gcc under Win95 expects 8.3 filenames because its
&gt; &gt; &gt; basicly a DOS interface port of gcc (runs in a DSO box).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This means, with our current file names, we will NEVER compile
&gt; &gt; &gt; under gcc.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suggestions?  I coudl change the names but upgrading is gonna be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pain. It woudl be better is we went to 8.3 for all cold source....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Uhrm, my original compile compiled everything with gcc in bash up to
&gt; &gt; net.c, where, it bombed on some network stuff I've since finished.  I
&gt; &gt; never did go back for a second attempt.  We never had any problems with
&gt; &gt; filename lengths.. (perhaps bash was doing something?)
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps he's not using win32bash...  I'll give it a try on an NT 4.0 box
&gt; this week and report back here...

Ive been unable to FIND win32bash.
Can someoen make a suggestion?
Im workign under Win95 btw not NT.
In the normal Dos shell, and every shell I've tried, i have the same
problem.  It seems to be mostly with include file names.
