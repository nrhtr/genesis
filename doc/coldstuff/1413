Brandon:

Has that order problem with disconnect() where the message is thrown before
the socket is actually closed fixed in this release?

Was it fixed earlier and did I miss it?

&gt;It is available, changes list:
&gt;
&gt;      * fixed a few minor memory leaks (Bruce)
&gt;      * fixed a maxint comparison problem (Brad)
&gt;      * reduced unecessary buffer copies when reading data from a
&gt;        connection, as well as redundant mallocs (Brandon)
&gt;      * fixed some problems with cancelling tasks straight from the
&gt;        driver (i.e. with kill -USR1) which caused a crash (Brandon)
&gt;      * fixed a problem with set_method_access()--was not complaining
&gt;        if the method did not exist (Bruce)
&gt;      * added the ability to do `[buf] * INT like on strings (Brad)
&gt;      * fixed a problem with the VEIL module (Brandon)
&gt;      * added the System/OS token as an element to $sys.version() (Brandon)
&gt;      * fixed a problem with cancelling or getting info on the currently
&gt;        executing task (Brandon)
&gt;      * adjusted select() to also check for file descriptors with
&gt;        exceptions--allowing for later cleanup (Brandon)
&gt;
&gt;For those wondering about Brian's BIG_FLOAT patches--I am going to branch
&gt;1.1-DEV from this release and include them.
