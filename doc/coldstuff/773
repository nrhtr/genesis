869683 Gillespie Brandon James drew these hieroglyphs:
^^^^^^
Why the number before your name?

&gt; &lt; 1. Call it something different.  send() just doesn't say 'fork'.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it seem's my impression of what send() was suggested as, is wrong.
&gt; They were suggesting send() as an in-db looping speedup, so you could replace:
&gt; 
&gt;   for obj in (object_list) {
&gt;       obj.(method)(@args);
&gt;   }
&gt; 
&gt; With:
&gt; 
&gt;   send(object_list, method, args);

Hmm.. I'm not sure I see the need for it.  The function wouldn't do
anything new, and a general-purpose word like "send" just doesn't hint
at looping either.  And I just write loops like that on one line -- I
had my MOO set up to let me use local copies of my verb source code
when editing, so one-liners like that didn't get expanded to three
lines.  (hint for the MCP folks)

&gt; &lt; 2. An argument for a delay time ala fork (n)
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, I dunno... I would like to add the delay times to pause(), with the
&gt; default of no args meaning a 0 second pause (just pop me at the back of
&gt; the current task list).  If you forked off, and wanted a delay, just call
&gt; pause() afterwards...

There is a difference.  In a delayed fork, the task doesn't exist
until it runs, and in a fork-then-pause, it does.  This does make a
difference.
