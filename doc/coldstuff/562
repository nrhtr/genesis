| Throw in a little racial bias and you'd make a
| good nazi (if there can be said to be such a thing as a "good nazi").

(Cf my previous question about disagreeing without being
disagreeable.  I think I need the increased efficiency of
this sort of exchange explained to me again.)

Mostly, I thought I'd comment that I'll nominate
Werner Heisenberg as a candidate for "good nazi".

Which comment seems at least as relevant to the
charter of this mailing list as the quote :)
