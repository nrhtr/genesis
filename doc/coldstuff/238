&lt;&gt; I want something like MOO's 'callers()' or 'player' in ColdMUD.  Is
&lt;&gt; this possible?  sender() only gives you the info from one level
&lt;&gt; back.  I need to know who or what is ultimately responsible for
&lt;&gt; calling the current method.  I'm trying to write a parser that can
&lt;&gt; call the user's .match_environment() so that all parsing is done by
&lt;&gt; one method call.  But sender() is useless beyond the first call, and
&lt;&gt; I can't find anything else that would do it.  Any ideas?
&lt;
&lt; This is tantamount to accessing global state, and is a poor design.
&lt; If you need this information, pass it in as an argument.

Alright, somebody (even Greg) has the same POV as me.

SamIAm's suggestion would be to have a connection(), which returns your
connection object, and to let you find user from there...
