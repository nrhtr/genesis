In leiu of me needing something to pull me away from some of my other projects,
I have packaged up my changes to ColdMUD in the ColdX 0.1 driver.  ColdX is
a derivitive work, different in name so as to lessen confusion between existing
ColdMUD driver development (wherever it may be...) and my own development.
Changes from Jordan's 0.12-0 driver include:

ColdX 0.1
    0.12-3
        * added signal handler
        * changed main loop structure, previously:
            1. flush_defunct connections/records
            2. handle all input and output events:
                1. [io]wait for something to happen
                2. handle connection input and output
                3. handle new and pending connections
            3. handle heartbeat
            4. run paused tasks
          now:
            1. flush_defunct connections/records
            2. [io]wait for something to happen
            3. handle connection input
            4. handle new and pending connections
            5. handle heartbeat
            6. handle connection output
            7. run paused tasks
        * changed a few function names:
            todbref()            =&gt; toobj()
            get_name()           =&gt; get_objnum()
            disconnect()         =&gt; close_connection()
            conn_assign()        =&gt; reassign_connection()
            run_script()         =&gt; execute()
            bind()               =&gt; bind_port()
            unbind()             =&gt; unbind_port()
            connect()            =&gt; open_connection()
            set_heartbeat_freq() =&gt; set_heartbeat()
            set_name()           =&gt; add_dbref()
            del_name()           =&gt; del_dbref()
            db_top()             =&gt; next_objnum()
        * added functions:
            status()   -- system status (`man rusage` for more info)
            load()     -- system load, define CHECK_LOAD in config.h
                          to use.  Note: this is not a good implementation.
            mtime()    -- microseconds (`man gettimeofday` for more info)
        * fixed strsub() bug (strsub("", "", ""))
        * Random code cleanup and rewrites
        * rewrote configure, made it better/more comprehensive
    0.12-1[b-c]: fixed some problems with configure and the
        server testing script. (Brandon)
    0.12-1 4-Nov-94: Brandon Gillespie / Alex Stewart
        Updated Documentation, created a baseline configure
        script, added bin/ and it's relative scripts,
        cleaned up file heirarchy.  Added write_err(),
        which goes to stderr (same as write_log before),
        write_log() goes to stdout and is (currently)
        only called in op_log().  Alex Stewart fixed
        compile warnings.  Major additions of this patch
        level include the file tree and the configure
        script system.

NOTE: Because of the function changes, no database will work with the driver,
out of the box.  I will be releasing a stripped version of the current CDC
core sometime soon.  Just note that this is a pre release version of CDC,
and a few things are not completed...(such as ctext and options need a few
tweaks, and commands are still in their half advanced state).

Enjoy, and feel free to swing by the Cold Dark (recumbent.declab.usu.edu:1138)
