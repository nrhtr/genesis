&gt; &gt; The problems which could arise with this is that the current POSIX

&gt; I think we should use Perl regexp (if you feel like isolating its
&gt; source). At least I can tell which characters need to be backslashed and
&gt; when in Perl regexp. :) It's also somewhat standard and powerful
&gt; enough.

Uhh, so by 'perl regexp' you mean you want henry spencer's regexp package 
with perly extensions?  Basically, the extended \x meanings, like \s, \d, 
etc?
