Someone on my serverr just asked me this ::

Person says, "I've been trying to find where the exit north is in my 
inventory and I can't see it anywhere!  Can you help"
Michael asks, "Uhm, what makes you think your carrying an *EXIT*
around?"
Person says, "IT said "you took the exit north.""
Michael asks, "It means you went through the exit.  How long has this
been troubling you?"
Person says, "About two weeks."
Michael asks, "And why dinna you ask me about it earlier?"
Person says, "I thought I could figure it out by myself."

At this point I check where he is connected from....  Guess what, AOL :)

This guy took one exit then spent over half a month figuring out where
the heck he put it....

(Names were changed to protect the innocent, and the dumb :))
