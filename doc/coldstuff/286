It might be more useful to have the portmapper port not be the
multiplexer port, i.e. use the portmapper port to get info on how the
server uses ports, while the other ports are actually the services. so
if you wanted a multiplexer, mebe put it on xxx4, with xxx2 the
standard for portmapper, and such. connecting to portmapper would show
the connecting server that this server does everything through xxx4,
and can react accordingly. with a multi-port style server, it would
show what ports were what service, and still could react
appropriately. 

	Just a thought.
