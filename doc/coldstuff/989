Okay,
I found my verifier problem and the original problem that was making Unix fail.  
Turns out that there are some differences in behavior btw Motif based awt and 
Windows based AWT (gonna have to razz 'em about that).  

In addition to the outright bug, which I fixed, there are some minor uglinesses 
under Motif having to do with default behaviors/settings that are different btw 
the two AWT implementations.  I guess I should eventually clean it up (or let Lynx 
do it ;), but its workign and available now off of the old link:
