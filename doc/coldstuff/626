Jeff says:
   I'm working  on that littel tiemr manager of mine, but I've been stumped 
   for a week. I CANNOT get CDC to recognize my new command (@tqueue).

   I did the follwoing:
	   1) defined a method queue_cmd
	   2) inherited has_commands
	   3) defined the following:
		   var $has_commands commands [["@tqueue",'queue_cmd]]
		   var $has_commands aliases []

   It compiled fine but when I type @queue it gives the usual mesages i see 
   for an unknown command.

   Do I have to attach this thing somewhere other then as a chidl of 
   has_commands to enable it to see input?  Are there any other steps I'm 
   missing??

   This is REALLY frustrating me.


Well, hopefully you've solved this by now, but reading your
description of the problem the obvious discrepancy leaps out at me:
	
&gt; var $has_commands commands [["@tqueue",'queue_cmd]] typing the
command @queue won't activate this command... hopefully it's just a
typo in the problem description ;)

I was having a problem with commands that sounded similar, but I
forgot what it was, it was I believe, related to the rehashing as
Brandon implied, also it was after I grabbed the new server (although
I still only use .10.3 as of yet so by new server I mean .10.3 instead
of .10 with a patch or two.) I'll try and find out what the problem
was once I have time again ;)
