&gt; I seem to be unable to get Genesis to compile on my system. During 'make',

&gt; versions.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any idea how, I would like to get a ColdCore up to dink
&gt; around with.
&gt; My system is setup as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; SunSPARC workstation (with 16 megs real ram and at least 64 swap)
&gt; SunOS Release 4.1.4_DBE1.4
&gt; 
&gt; I have attempted it both with a 10 meg quota and none. Neither way works.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is un unkown problem then I will send the output from configure and
&gt; make... I didn't want to flood the list with big huge files if it wasn't
&gt; necessary.

Send the output from Make, and the output from: /bin/uname -a

You may be out of luck--the older SunOS has some problems and is not
ANSI/POSIX standard, which Genesis assumes your compiler is.  My
suggestion would be to hitup the administrator to upgrade to Solaris or to
install NetBSD on it, both of which are ANSI and mostly POSIX compliant
(enough that it doesnt matter anymore).
