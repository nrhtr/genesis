Heya :)

I'm currently doing a bit of coding in coldC and as I work with distances
I came to remark that Genesis defaults to a very low-precision floating
point type for real numbers.

I already asked about this on tCD and Bruce suggested I sent here to ask
wether someone still had access to a patch that must have once existed for
this.
Still, while I haven't peeked at the code, I can't imagine it'd be too
difficult to modify it to use doubles rather than floats... (I hope... :)

Thanks,
-- Sim.
