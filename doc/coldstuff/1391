&gt; Unless you're working with a mixture of Java and non-Java code, you may

&gt; useful capability, though there's talk of adding it to the standard.

Visigenic (now part of of Borland) and Netscape had Caffeine for handling 
this which appears to headed towards being official.  There are several 
free CORBA ORBs, including a couple of Java ones.  Look in 
comp.object.corba and http://adams.patriot.net/~tvalesky/freecorba.html
and http://linas.org/linux/corba.html

However, I would be really concerned about speed.

&gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've started playing with Kelvin again.  This version is beig coded in JAVA
&gt; &gt; for a variety of reasons.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; An issue I've come across -- I've been reading up on CORBA and it looks
&gt; &gt; like a very intresting thing to base this on.  Th one problem is that JAVA
&gt; &gt; CORBA ORBs and coding kits all seem VERY expensve (int the 1 to 3 grand
&gt; &gt; range.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't suppsoe anyone knows of a cheap but decent JAVA CORBA implementation?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just checking.
