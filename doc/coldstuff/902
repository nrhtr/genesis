&gt; &gt;   Is this part a joke or is there a way to get in if say the admin forget's
&gt; &gt; his/her password?  If so, nice idea...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a joke, there really is a backdoor login, but you will still
&gt; need a password to use it. The idea is to use backdoor to fix broken
&gt; command parsing and similar problems.

The backdoor uses all of it's own code, (rather than hooking into 
previous modules).  This is in an attempt to be able to connect to a 
broken server if any portion of the db is wedged.  However, the backdoor 
is very restrictive.  Infact, you can't even open a connection unless 
your host is one of a select few (defaulting to 127.0.0.1, I would not 
suggest using anything else frankly).  From there it actually requires
one system password, and two user passwords (two may be redundant, but
*shrug*).
