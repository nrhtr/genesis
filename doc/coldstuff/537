Riche has proposed adding a request_callback() routine to 'schedule' the
 execution of the $sys.callback method at the server's convienience, and
 removing pause() on the grounds that it could be replaced with an in-db
 method to do the same thing.

pause() replenishes the current frame's ticks. It was intended for loops
 which would be known to run a long time or possibly indefinitely. It was
 supposed to provide the functionality of MOOs suspend(0).

If functions were added to allow direct manipulation of various tick counts
 then pause() could be written in-db without a callback thing. You could do
 it with the heartbeat.

So I see no use for the callback system proposed and request a system of
 direct tick manipulation.
