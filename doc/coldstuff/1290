Ok, a feature/bug has arisen as a problem due to being overlooked.  When I
did forked methods I didn't have the code reset the call depth--at the
time I thought about it and figured it was a good thing, but... is it?
Pretending the calldepth is 10, if a method at calldepth 8 calls a forked
method the forked method only has a calldepth of 2 overall, which can be
VERY confusing in tracebacks and is also not necessarily what people would
expect...

Should this be how forked methods behave, or should they get a fresh
calldepth?  or perhaps a special 'reduced but still big' forked
calldepth..
