&gt; Encapsulation.  MOO breaks encapsulation by allowing one to inherit

Ok, I can see that, but did you mention once that you were planing allow 
individual parameters to be marked for some such behavior? 

At any rate I can adapt :) 


This leads then to another question:
  If I specificly assign the parameter from the parent in an .init_ 
method that is called on the child at the time of @spawning:
  
	that_parameter = .parents()[1].get_that_value(); 

and if that_value happens to be a long list, is the whole list _copied_ or 
is a reference passed?
