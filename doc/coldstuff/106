It has occurred to several of us that the development of TinyM* related
servers is all following similar lines, and is, in fact, all merging to
some extent.

With this in mind, we have set up a new mailing list, devoted to discussion
amongst those working on TinyM* genre servers.  If you are one of those
people, you are invited to subscribe to the list, where you'll be kept
in contact with your peers in this field.  (Yes, as TinyM* servers grow
into pseudo operating systems, this should be considered a field.)  The
mailing list is primarily meant for discussion of what we're currently
working on, with emphasis on modularity and implementation.  As the purpose
of this group implies, those working on all TinyM* genre servers are
welcome to participate.
