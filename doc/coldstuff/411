&gt;This isn't really a faq, but we've had the same question three times in a very
&gt; short span of time with some vague answers but no resolution. I avoided
&gt; answering the questions because there are no definite answers, however, I will
&gt; tell you what I know:

Thank you, this information is much appreciated...

&gt;  Jordan Baker continues to do server hacking. He and others are trying to find
&gt;   and squash the bug which is causing the server to hang on linux machines. He
&gt;   also plans to add floating-point support. There has been talk of adding more
&gt;   attributes to methods besides "disallow_overrides", specifically "private"
&gt;   and "instance_only". The first has been successfully added to 0.12.0, but
&gt;   was removed because Jordan didn't trust the changes bug-wise. He also isn't
&gt;   yet convinced that it is a Good Thing (tm).

I would like to help with this.  I am running on a linux machine right
now, and am very interested in floating point support.  Is there a 
contact point for this effort?

I am currently trying to plan out a database with three dimensional
coordinates, events, and possibly adding some sort of distributed 
support, barring how much dreaming I do.
