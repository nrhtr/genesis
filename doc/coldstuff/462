This is primarily directed towards Greg, but others may be interested.

I am primarily wondering as to the design considerations in respect to
networking/connections, and which methods are called (and how).

Basically the thing which throws me (and may just be a bug) is when initiating
an "outbound" connection the server will call $object.connect() with one
argument (which is the socket).  However, when an "inbound" connection is
established the server calls $object.connect() with TWO arguments (ip address
and socket).

Was this intentional or just an oversight?

Thanks
