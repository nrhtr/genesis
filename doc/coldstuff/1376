300+ online users and web integration, and they don't want to pay a penny?

It'd blow the connection budget in no-time.

&gt; NBC Online/Homicide plans to include an RPG mud as part of their online
&gt; offerings.
&gt; (http://www.nbc.com)
&gt; Their intention is to have some sort of mud that can be used to exend
&gt; the Homicide/Second Story series that's being developed for the web; all
&gt; this is in support of the television series Homicide.
&gt;
&gt; NBC Online will not pay for the project (what a surprise!), but they are
&gt; willing to have online promotion for the mud/company that gets involved
&gt; with the project.  Currently I'm tossing around some ideas with their
&gt; software developer and their producer, but I'm not interested in
&gt; promotion.  However, if someone can make a decent Homicide RPG Cold, it
&gt; could really help give Cold a boost.
&gt;
&gt; I'm willing to provide the Black Rabbit server as a "proof of concept"
&gt; server, but the Homicide RPG will have to be moved off the server by the
&gt; end of March.  This means that the project will have to find another
&gt; machine.  If a sponsor for the site can be found, then that sponsor
&gt; should get the promotion from NBC Online.
&gt;
&gt; The project will also need a builder or two and an admin.  If anyone is
&gt; interested on working on this project, I will give you complete mud
&gt; control so you can get the job done.
&gt;
&gt; There are also some technical problems.  They want the mud to be able to
&gt; handle 300+ online users. I believe that LambdaMOO lags to an impossible
&gt; level at over 200-- don't know how well a Cold could handle that many.
&gt; Many two servers is better.  Suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Another concern is the use of the web.  I'm still not clear on this
&gt; requirement, but I know that they want to tie it in to their web page
&gt; some way.  If you look at the NBC web page, you will see that they make
&gt; heavy use of web technology, including lots of javascripts, and maybe
&gt; even java.  I don't really know what to do about this part.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, there will be some use of NPCs.  The "proof of concept" will
&gt; have to include some functional NPCs, TBD.
&gt;
&gt; So what do you think?  Is that a project worth doing and are there
&gt; enough resources in the Cold community to make it happen?  It's not a
&gt; great project if you want to run your own mud.  But it may enhance your
&gt; resume.
&gt;
&gt; So send me some email if you are interested in the project,
&gt;
