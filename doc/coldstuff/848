&gt; &gt; Brandon in his last notes says something about removing the 
&gt; &gt; ColdCC functionality from genesis.  I just wanted to make sure that 
&gt; &gt; the object manipulation funtions, including compile and decompile, 
&gt; &gt; would remain.  I need them for my project and it woudl in general be 
&gt; &gt; very difficult to implement most classic forms of Muds without them.
&gt; 
&gt; There is no compile_object() or decompile_object() function available in 
&gt; ColdC _now_, so I would not be removing that

Not compile object, compile method, which IS at least in Coldmud...

&gt; 
&gt; However, as to your question, the reason I havn't considered it a problem 
&gt; is because you have the ability to fully decompile a binary db, in-db.  
&gt; Infact, ColdCore includes some routines for decompiling the db (none for 
&gt; compiling though).

The function was called compile()

Don't touch it and I'm happy.
