Hi,

ColdC/Genesis is an incredibly flexible system.  Part of that flexibility
is the fact that almost everything imaginable is left to the softcode.
This means that you start with basically nothing except the natives, and
work your way up from there.  IE, you write your own networking code
(using the provided natives, though)  Thus, if you want to start something
like this in Cold/Genesis, you'll need to get experience with ColdC first.

ColdC provides an interface to the 'real world' (host filesystem) by
allowing the execution of scripts in a certain directory.  It also has
some file access commands, but these probably aren't everything you need.
Thus, the interface could certainly be done in ColdC/Genesis, but there
would need to be scripts to handle the actual manipulation of the file
system.

Sounds like a nifty project, good luck.  :)

&gt;  Excuse the pretentionism, but after playing with the "adventure.sh"
&gt; script that comes with bash [0], I thought "wouldn't it be cool if you

&gt; 
&gt;  So, I wrote:
&gt;     http://www.RedBrick.dcu.ie/~valen/muce.ps
&gt;  as a kind of a joke. A few friends thought "that would be cool actually".
&gt; For those too lazy to read it, it's basically saying that "wouldn't it be
&gt; nice if you could run a mud-like virtual machine on your PC, and import
&gt; files from your PC (running windows, or unix, or whatever - it shouldn't
&gt; matter) as objects in a mud-like world. Then, you could clone a load of
&gt; URL objects, for instance, "go" to a friends "house" - which is a room, on
&gt; his PC, and do something like "give knapsack.urls to friend" or something.
&gt; 
&gt;  Anyway, I was thinking that if we were going to toy with this idea, the
&gt; Cold system might be a cunning place to start. If any of the developers
&gt; could have a look at the file, and tell me if I would be better off
&gt; starting from scratch, of from something like Circle mud, I'd appreciate
&gt; it.

&gt; [0] adventure.sh comes with the bash 2.x source distro. It's cool - try it
&gt; out - it lets you walk around your file system, picking up files into a
&gt; "knapsack", and dumping them into different directories. You can feed
&gt; files to the "rm" monster, etc.
