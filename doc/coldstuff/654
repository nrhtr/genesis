If you are starting a coldmud and need help from someone who has done server
 hacking and started more than a few coldmuds I can assist you. I am in
 the middle of looking for an RL job, as well as being a wiz at two MOOs and
 a Cold (where I am acting as a source of information and such), so I can't
 guarentee anything.

If, however, you send me mail at crag@serial.io.com I can meet you somewhere
 and help you get started. I will also try to send whatever answers I give
 to this list for inclusion in the FAQ.

Thinks like select: forever wait means set_heartbeat hasn't been run which
 means $sys.startup probably han't run which means you probably have NULL files
 in binary/ due to a failed restart. It is always easier to start from a
 textdump, if a little slower.

I can sometimes be reached at
 sensemedia.net ports 6666(cold) and 7777(moo)
