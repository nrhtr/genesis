&gt;     Greetings, I was wondering if there was a port of this whole project to
&gt; Win95/98? I would greatly appreciate it.. =oD

There has been a lot of work of late on updating the Windows port of
Genesis.  There are a couple of remaining problems, which while fairly
minor, will decide whether or not it becomes part of the 1.1p6 or 1.1p7
release.

I have a relatively current copy of the binaries at work on my machine,
and if you like, I can mail them to you either tomorrow (Sunday) or Monday
while I'm in the office.

Any current core that runs on Genesis on unix should run the same on
Windows.
