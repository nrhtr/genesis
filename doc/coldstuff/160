In C-- in general, and in the colddark db, haw does accessing
an objects variables work? There are usually functions that
return the variable if called, but rarely is there a function
to set it. well, ok maybe rarely is an understatement, but in
this case, where the variable is protected by encapsulation, 
i cant resort to the MOOcode equivalent of ;$obj.prop = val
(or can i?)
as a corralary/aside, it seems that each param should have an
accessor for it which, if called with no args returns the value
of the associated variable (which is the current case usually i believe), and if called with args, sets the variable (perms depending of course) and if it cant for some reason returns an
error
Just some ramblings as i endevor to comprehend this stuff.
