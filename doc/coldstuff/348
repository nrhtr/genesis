&gt; &gt; While server-based floating point support would be far faster, it would not
&gt; &gt;  be exceedingly difficult to code floating point in-db. This seems to me
&gt; &gt;  to be a nicer solution from a server development perspective. Besides,
&gt; &gt;  I doubt very much that ColdMUD would be fast enough to be useful as a
&gt; &gt;  simulation language. I think you'd be better off writing your simulation
&gt; &gt;  in C or C++ and using someone's libraries.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, there is already a Space Simulation running on Micromuse based apon
&gt; 10 second updates(ships move every 10 secs) with almost 100 'objects' floating
&gt; around in space currently that is a hybrid of C(in server) and MUSE code(online)to act as an interface. The C portion of the code currently runs in under one
&gt; second every update. I believe Coldmud due to its unique nature would be able
&gt; to handle 10 second updates although of course it'd have to been seen to be
&gt; known.

TrekMOO has a space simulation system running on variable updates.  Movement
is only computed when reqested by the moving object.  Each object has a 
variable update time.  Planets, etc. don't move at all, while ships move 
on a roughly 2 second update.  With over 40 objects in space, we do 
experience `code lag' from time to time (which the code is made to 
compensate for), but you mus realize, that 1) its a MOO :) 2) 95% of the 
code is in db.  The only in-server routines are the ones necessary for 
floating point calcs. (not nearly as important to a space simulation as 
you'd think)
