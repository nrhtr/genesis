The more I think about it, the more I believe that the driver should
dump object's with their dbref rather than objnum, _if one is assigned_.

This would do a few things:

    a: would make going back to a base level 'core' much easier.
    b: would give an easy means to reset object number counters in an
       existing db (TCD's is up to ~8000, nothing high, but still high
       nonetheless, considering there are ~200 actual objects).

I could think up more reasons, but my head hurts.  What is the general
consensus upon this?

(you would still be able to get the objnum from the 'name dbref objnum'
line, so if you wanted to reset you would go and renumber those lines only).
