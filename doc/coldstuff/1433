Good day all!

Some of you already know that Genesis is back under active development.
The 1.2 version brings a lot of change internally to the driver.  Some of
the upcoming changes will include the use of threads inside the driver.
This will not be affecting the multitasking model of the ColdC language
for now, but things like the ColdC compiler, the network layer, and
possibly file I/O.  However, like all changes, this has problems.  Threads
are not supported on all platforms.

Are any of you out there using Genesis on such platforms?  Does anyone out
there need to have a non-threaded version?

Please feel free to respond back to the list or to me privately with any
issues, comments, concerns or questions.

 - Bruce
