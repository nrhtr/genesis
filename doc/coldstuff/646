Following Crag's advice, i modified object_new to set the dirty bit. I haven't
tested his program yet to see if it works differently but i can garantee that
it doesn't solve my problem. Furthermore, i found some interesting results
about textdump which follow, the following results happen every time after a
reboot. These results are from a Solaris machine(SunOS mes03 5.3 Generic_Patch
sun4m sparc)

Size of the textdump before shutdown
490780 Jan 23 15:00 textdump
First textdump after shutdown
230646 Jan 23 15:35 textdump
Following textdumps.
389601 Jan 23 15:37 textdump
493183 Jan 23 15:38 textdump
493183 Jan 23 15:39 textdump

All the textdumps after the last one depicted here have the same size. This
happened every time i tried and even after i made the changes to object.c on
the function object_new. What puzzles me is that it does not happen on
DG/UX... At least under the same circomstances... So I would not think it is
an algorithm error... At least it would be a machine dependent one...
