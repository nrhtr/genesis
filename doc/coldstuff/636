&lt; Just in case the request line is open and before I forget
&lt; again, what about including SUFFIX,PREFIX?
&lt;
&lt; Should these two commands be in the server or in the
&lt; database(s)?  Or are they already in the server and
&lt; I didn't look carefully enough.

They are not currently in the server or any databases which I know about.

Personally, I do not plan on implementing them.  They are a primitive hack,
and a much better system can be designed and implemented (totally in-db).
(Of course, I'm the one who thinks you should encode all text and use a
specifically designed client).

Of course, I would say this is more an in-db concern.
