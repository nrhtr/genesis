&gt; Supposedly, if you have the patience, you can compile cold on win32.  You 
&gt; need access to a unix box first, to build the win32 source files.  All 
&gt; you need to do is get into a unix shell, type make win32, tar up the 
&gt; resulting source files, then attempt compile/configuration in NT.  I 
&gt; tried this once on an NT 4 beta box, with GNUwin32 gcc, but it failed 
&gt; part way through.  I would imagine if you know your way around C well
&gt; enough (I know basics, but most is over my head) you could kludge your 
&gt; way through it all.  If you try it and have success, please let me know.

Yes, that is how :)

I started a Win32 port when I had a system here running Win95+VisualC and
the GNUWin32 stuff (I was working on getting it to compile in both).
However, the guy left and I havn't had the desire/drive to install the
same setup and work on it.  I do have Win95/Visual C nestled on a small
partition of my drive at home, eventually I'll get to it..  If you want,
compile it up and send me a log of all the errors--I can probably fix them
and send you a patch.  A few bounces back and forth like that should be
all we need to finish it up.
