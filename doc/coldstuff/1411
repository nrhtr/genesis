ColdCore 3.0a10 is available.  It has many fixes (of course).  Notable
things that I can recall at this time:

    * $paths -- eg two-way-exits
    * new command caching system, faster, cleaner, no remote command problems
    * a lot more help documentation, thanks to many other people contributing
    * an introductory tutorial (@tutorial)
    * POP3 daemon (somewhat inefficient on large mail folders, being fixed)

There is also an upgrade program available; however, if you are going to
be upgrading contact me--I have a few methods that will convert older
exits to use $paths.

Enjoy;
