Yeah, the minimal db is intended as a basic foundation for many uses, it 
just includes the basics for most applications.  You can build anything 
on top of it.  An example of what can be build is an online catalog 
interacting with a database at:

    http://www.roundrocks.com:1234/newslate

The version available currently is actually several months old; the 
newest version interacts directly with a product database using SQL.  All 
of it is based off the minimal db, it generates the pages on the fly, 
catering to the users's connection.

There will be a ColdCore available sometime, which is what I suspect you 
actually want.
