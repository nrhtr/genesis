&gt; Umm, whats the difference between adding something to the containers contents, 
&gt; and asking the container to add someting to its contents? and why is adding 
&gt; someting to the cointaier's contents not setting the containers contents variable?

Hsm, Zachary already covered this, but i'm feeling like a bastich so i'll do it
again, in simple terms (as thats all I can think of them in ;)

   $you are an object, $he is an object, you are carrying $it.  In order for
$you to give $it to $he you do NOT simply take his ,contents parameter and tack
him onto the end of the list, $you calls $he.new_content($it) the .new_content
(or whatever its called, these are bogus names) method then adds it to its own
contents.  For all $you know, $he is adding $it to a parameter called
,my_wankin_contents, and you dont care.

Anyhow, I know what you are going through.  When I first snagged coldmud Greg
was cringing in fear when he'd see "Connected: Lynx" wherever he was at, and
i'd run up and ask him just about the same question's you've asked so far 8)

I've since come to understand the point of view Greg is coming from, and
actually like it better than MOO.  Well, cold is just all around better than
MOO, like I havn't said that enough already.  B)
