GBH:
&gt; Let me make one thing absolutely clear:

&gt; The Coldmud server has absolutely no idea what an admin is.  The
&gt; server has, in fact, absolutely no idea how your database happens to
&gt; represent people, or how it implements security.  Brandon explained
&gt; that certain built-in functions were limited to $sys (in particular,
&gt; anything that causes an affect on the world outside the database),
&gt; but that's the only security implemented in the server.

Thanks for the clarification :) It IS important to know what is a
server function, and what is a DB function, and I'll readily admit I'm
unclear on this still. Note though that my main objection is to making
log a DB function, but that is because I see log as a
hacking-detection tool, as opposed to something else, and log itself
being in-db is not a security hole or something.

I guess theoretically then, I can just make $sys not allow access to
the log function for anyone, right?

&gt; If all calls to $sys.eval, $sys.compile, and all methods on $sys
&gt; which modify ,admins are logged, then Ray/Ashs senario is
&gt; invalid. The time of modifying $sys.log and/or $sys,admins will be
&gt; in the log.

Mmm, yoeh if mods to log were logged (besides perhaps being
recursive?) then you'd be able to see the hole.  

&gt; Your scenarios all have human error on the part of the admins in
&gt; them, too.  I don't think you can justify time in log() based on
&gt; that. I claim that the current version of the server can be made
&gt; equally or more secure than MOO, which has been hacked once in
&gt; Lambda's history (by Quinn). It has been lagged miserably by an
&gt; unknown programmer, but that's a different kind of issue.

Note that I stopped justifying time in log(), I've always stated that
this is just a preference. My concern here was the ability to turn off
logging on-line, or modify the output of log in-db. Pointing at human
error is not in my opinion an excuse for securtity problems. Human
error should be assumed, and measures taken to minimized the damage it
can do. Having a secure system log is one method of doing this. But it
seems apparent that all this requires is the proper restrictions on
$sys. (There is a reason, in fact numerous ones, why I like ColdMUD,
after all :) Sorry if im getting kinda annoying about this.
