Wow, I realize this is a very belated response, sorry!

The reason for low precision is because cold bytecode is 32bits.
Double precision is not, and thus requires either all bytecode to be
32bits for the most simple change, or other additional changes have to
be made (like splitting the floating value into two chunks).  If you
are on a 64bit system youcan play with USE_BIG_FLOATS and
USE_BIG_NUMBERS in src/include/defs.ht.  I dont recall anything about
the stability of either of these values.

&gt; Heya :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently doing a bit of coding in coldC and as I work with distances
&gt; I came to remark that Genesis defaults to a very low-precision floating
&gt; point type for real numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; I already asked about this on tCD and Bruce suggested I sent here to ask
&gt; wether someone still had access to a patch that must have once existed for
&gt; this.
&gt; Still, while I haven't peeked at the code, I can't imagine it'd be too
&gt; difficult to modify it to use doubles rather than floats... (I hope... :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
