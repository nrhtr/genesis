I'm finishign up the logon daemon for my mud and I'm having a problem.

The way i WANTED to write it, the daemon woudl wait for a connection, 
then spawn a child and pass the connection off.

Reassign_connection though,a ccording to the docs, will ONLY work if 
called from sys.

This seems pretty pointless as it limits reassignment to connections
originally made to sys.

I have a work around but its definately not as clean.  It also in general 
makes me question the usefulness of teh reassign_conenction call.

What am i missing?
