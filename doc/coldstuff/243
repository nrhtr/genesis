Ok, basically, I _really_ dont like the idea of having to copy an object just
to clear a parameter.  You shouldn't have to do this.  To explain I will map:


Object: $foo
Param:  $root dbref 'foo
Param:  $achoo zoo_param 'value
Param:  $foo  foo_param 'value

Parent: $foo
Object: $doo
Param:  $root dbref 'doo
Param:  $achoo zoo_param 'nuther_different_value
Param:  $foo foo_param 'second_value

Now, I come along and remove foo_param from object $foo and it looks like:

Object: $foo
Param:  $root dbref 'foo
Param:  $achoo zoo_param 'value

Parent: $foo
Object: $doo
Param:  $root dbref 'doo
Param:  $achoo zoo_param 'nuther_different_value
Param:  $foo foo_param 'second_value

NOW, on Object $doo foo_param still exists.  This is because of encapsulation,
great, dandy.  HOWEVER, I cannot access foo_param on $doo, nor can I _EVER_
remove foo_param from $doo, it will ALWAYS stay there collecting dust and
cobwebs! (grumble).

So, once again I would propose:

     clear_parameter($defining_object, 'parameter)

Which is called from the object that it is currently residing on.  This would
not break encapsulation, and it would fix what I see as a gaping wound in the
side of ColdMUD.  Oh, and it would allow me to release a core the way I feel it
should be done (with objects uninitialized).  With the above primitive and the
even further above example I could type:

(run by object $doo)

    clear_param($foo, 'foo_param);

Which would remove it. (as del_param does on object $foo).

My implementation for this would be to have .uninit call clear_param for all
objects (assuming that clear_param does not DELETE the parameter on the
defining parent).  Then when we do a core simply uninitialize all objects.  I
am currently pondering having .uninit set all params as something obivously not
normal like 'this_is_a_corified_value_that_can_be_hosed_sometime  Then we could
use a simple sed to remove the parameters from the database (but this is damn
ugly).
