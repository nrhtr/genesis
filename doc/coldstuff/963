After hours of toil it is available.  This is the 1.0 alpha version, all 
that is left for 1.0 Genesis is:

    * bug fixes (report them!)
    * math/trig functions need to be hooked in (sin(), cos() etc)

There is no core available for this yet, other than those which have been 
upgraded.  This is an alpha release, but I would like people to test it, 
use the minimal db and play around, push native methods; they are the 
newest and I'd like to try and find any problems with them now, and not 
later.  If you want to add a native method talk to me online and I can 
step you through it (ice.cold.org:1138).

From the release notes in the distribution:

If you are using a 0.4 database, you can upgrade easilly.  Dump your
database to text (coldcc -d), edit it and search for the following
functions, replacing them with their native counterparts.  Make sure
you have the objects in your database for those counterparts, and that
the methods they are using are not already defined:

      hostname()      =&gt;   $network.hostname()
      ip()            =&gt;   $network.ip()
      status()        =&gt;   $sys.status()
      next_objnum()   =&gt;   $sys.next_objnum()
      version()       =&gt;   $sys.version()
      strftime()      =&gt;   $time.format()
      encode()        =&gt;   $http.encode()
      decode()        =&gt;   $http.decode()

You will also have to update any calls to strfmt(), two changes to the
function have been made:

      1 - Data arguments are no longer specified in a list, instead
          they simply follow the format.
      2 - Formatting has changed, read the documentation at:

             http://www.cold.org/ColdC/Functions/strfmt.html

Known problems:

    * renaming a native method will cause mondo problems when you
      decompile it to text and try to recompile it back to binary,
      DO NOT DO THIS right now.

If you want to blow away any regular method definitions with their
native counterpart (such as $list.length(), etc) then you compile the
textdb using the '-f' flag to coldcc (force native methods to override
existing methods).  I would suggest examining each native method first,
they are listed in 'src/modules/moddef.h'
