The Cold Dark isn't a 'Core' in the common sense.  It is just the last textdump
from a previously running Server.  There is a lot there you probably don't want
for a core, but if you are up to it, it wouldn't take too much effort to strip
out all that you don't want and start anew.  Also, there are a lot of projects
only half finished.  The help system doesn't work because it was intentionally
broken (it actually did work).  It was an older one written by Quo Vadis which
I wasn't too fond of and was going to rewrite (it is 'hypertext' but not a very
good system--it is a tree structure and I prefer web structures better).
