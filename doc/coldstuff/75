Ok, i'm sick of tracking this down, i'll get it eventually, but I figure I may
as well throw out the problem where other's can see it.

the Cold Dark has been down lately because I have been trying to merge our
world with cold world 4.0.  (BTW, i created a chop.c file which chops up
a textdump into .c-- files, if anybody wants it scream).  I'm rather sure i
have everything merged together right, and the first person to connect after
I restart the server CAN connect, but after that NOBODY can ever get anything
other than the basic connection (ie not even the welcome message).  I'm going
to go through connection.c-- _again_ (sigh), anyhow.
