oh oh.  I get:
	the mail_list ($mail_list) is not a fertile object.

I know that you guys talked about this fertile stuff but I said "heck...
i'll never have to know this."  Is this a thing that is turned on/off like
the core so that you can't spawn at the shallow end of the pool unless 
you are fertile?



As for the SMTP mail relay stuff, my eyes got crossed when I looked at it.
I think it involves me doing something that Mudservices would not like for
me to do.
