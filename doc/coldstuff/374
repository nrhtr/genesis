Richelieu spaketh:
&lt;&gt; set_name()    =&gt; set_objname()
&lt;&gt; del_name()    =&gt; del_objname()
&lt;&gt; get_name()    =&gt; get_objnum()
&lt;
&lt; Umm, I thought those were going to become set_dbref(), etc..  and why is
&lt; get_name becoming get_objnum when all the others use "objname"?  Or is get_name
&lt; really a different function than I'm assuming here and not related to the
&lt; others?

Crag suggested objname in place of objnum because it makes even more sense:
                        
  Object Number       |    vs    |   Object Number
  Object Name         |          |   Database Reference

It sounded fine to me...

As for get_objnum, that is what the function does (i.e. it gets the objnum of
'objname).

Jeff T.P. chiseled:
&lt;&gt; dict_add_elem()
&lt;&gt; dict_del_elem() =&gt; remove (since they are disappearing anyway)
&lt;
&lt; I know I have very important code that uses both of these extensively.
&lt; I'd like to have them left in personally.  I know it can be done in db,
&lt; but how quickly?  Speed again is the consideration.  If it can be done in
&lt; the database without considerable loss of speed, then nevermind. . .

Well, I have not used the *_elem methods much, because I couldn't see much of a
difference between dict_add/del, other than a slight more touch of detail for
what is going on.  However, the more I consider this the more I think it may be
a good idea to leave it in, because sometimes that higher level of detail is
wanted and there really ISNT a pressing reason to rip them out (is there
Greg?).

(BTW, with W3 pages. you can leave them in ftp://www.usu.edu/incoming and just
 drop me an email message)

(oh, BTW BTW, they are giving me and the other W3 admin an alpha400 (muahaha))
