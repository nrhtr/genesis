&gt; 1) will ColdMUD run on an Intel box running Linux (and if so, what
&gt; would you recommend as a minimum/medium configuration to support,
&gt; oh, 6 players for development, or 64 players for eventual public
&gt; use?)

Yes, Linux is one of my testing platforms.  I really don't know how
well Coldmud scales at this point, since there aren't any running that
even fill up the object cache to the point where it swaps objects to
disk.  I'd say that for development, you could expect Coldmud to take
up one to two megabytes of RAM; for production use with 64 players,
maybe six to seven megabytes, but this is complete speculation.

(If there are severe scaling problems with Coldmud, then I intend to
work on them, of course.)

&gt; 2) what are the usage restrictions on ColdMUD?  He's thinking in
&gt; terms of running a pay-access BBS with a well-developed game
&gt; (apparently he's seen it work elsewhere with somewhat idiotic games,
&gt; so...).

There aren't any restrictions on using Coldmud commercially; it's in
the public domain.
