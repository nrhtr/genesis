This may be considered marginally interesting or useful information at best by
 most of you, but here it is: I have moved to Austin, TX (from Tigard, OR)
 where I am being a serious more-than-full-time programmer with
 The Prometheus Project. My involvement with things will probably be much like
 Zachary's, as we are not only in the same city, but similiar boats as well.

Anyway, I am overjoyed to hear that Brandon has struck out on his own with the
 server, as I was afraid nothing was going to get done, or even worse, that the
 'wrong thing' was going to get done. I think he has made a wise choice. I also
 congradulate him on his impending(?) marriage.

Finally, Greg, if you're still reading this, please change my email address
 from deforest@netcom.com to crag@serial.io.com.

Thank you.
