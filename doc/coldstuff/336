&gt; For the actual question though, any comments?

As to the feasibility/advisability of feeding stdout/stderr to
coldmud?  Eminently... medium term.

It's one of the subgoals I've had for a long while.
It's not as easy to do, well, as to suggest, however.

May I suggest you collect your spell checking output in a file,
and use the builtin to echo it, when complete, or use the
faucet approach you suggested?  I know it's not optimal, from
an execution point of view, but it is from a systemic Coldmud
development point of view (ie: mine :)

Please don't be worried that it's an implementation hack,
after all, isn't the hiding of necessary kludges one of the
benefits of encapsulation?

Colin.
