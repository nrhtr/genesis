OK, I have returned to comment on this subject:

Default ports are keen.  However, if someone wants to change that, they
should be able to.  Of course, this brings up the problem of how to
tell WHAT ports person_x is using.  For instance, I hate the idea of
using 5550..that's such a boring port number.  For Phoenix, I would use
something like 1717 or maybe some other derivation there-on.  (For the
reasoning, you should remember that the culture of the theme places
quite a bit of respect in the number 17).  Of course, this implies
I would not want to connect to other MUDs, so it may not be important,
And I could run the other services (finger, etc) on the standard ports.

Tough to say.
