Ok, first of all, I reconsidered my position about server IO stuff and came to
the conclusion that it should be possible for the server to send and receive
ANY characters supported by the transmission protocol.  Anything else would be
unnecessarily limiting and likely to cause problems in the future as this type
of system is used for more and more diverse applications.  This does not mean,
however, that _users_ should be able to enter anything they want to into
messages and such.  I believe Greg's solution to this is quite reasonable
(except that I don't really see the need for a separate data type).

I do _not_ believe that allowing non cooked input from text-dump stuff is a
bug.  This should be allowed, particularly if the IO is modified to allow
such characters, because then important data may be lost in the process of a
text dump/reload (although then a text dump wouldn't be a text dump anymore,
also.. I'm not sure how this should be dealt with).

As for the rest of this stuff, what I would suggest is that everyone who can
should move over to rec.games.mud and start working out an actual protocol.
This is not a task that needs to be taken on by just one person, and this is a
perfect use for that newsgroup, since it really has very little to do with
ColdMUD specifically.  Up till now I've paid very little attention to
rec.games.mud, but I'll start looking at it more.  Basically, stop whining
about the lack of a protocol and &lt;revolutionary concept warning&gt; let's actually
MAKE one.
