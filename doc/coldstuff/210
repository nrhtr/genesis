&lt; Yes, I know this has been mailed out recently, but I just went nuts and
&lt; cleared out all the old mail in my mailbox today and lost it...
&lt; where can I find it?

I'm creating a patched source right now.

&lt; Also, I had a question about the core.  I was looking back at my notes on
&lt; coolMUD and noticed that it's core was much simpler.  As in you had a root
&lt; object, then a described and located object, then under those two, thing,
&lt; room, exit, and player... Now I can see breaking one or two of those down
&lt; some, but is there a reason for having so many different parent objects in
&lt; the core?  Or is a lot of that just in there for the sake of having a little
&lt; of something for everyone.

My guess would be because its cool.  (shrug)
