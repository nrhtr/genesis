I am curious to know if anyone has an operating coldmud db that 
is open for business?  If so, I'd like to know the address so I
could take a look at what has been done with it.

Also, what is the best way to get started writing a coldmud db?
I understand that this would probably be starting with writing
a "textdump" that the server could read in, but I don't know the
exact format for a textdump, so if anyone has any docs for this, 
please point me in the right direction.

Thanks much,
-- david.
