Greetings!

I am the proud owner of a bastard child of ColdMUD called AR.  Essentially, 
its coldmud will full floating point math, advanced math libraries and a 
dynamic matrix for vector mapping.  It also has a few other nifty features 
like a full featured editor, mail system and other in-db niceties.

My question is this:  What else is there on the todo list? I would like to 
keep up with the coldmud development if at all possible.  I've started a 
'private' function to limit access to a method to other methods on the same 
object, but beyond that I'm starting to run out of ideas.

I'm gearing AR (Absoulte Reality) as an engineering tool, since I plan to 
use it to model satellite comms and tracking as part of my PhD.  So, any 
sugestions to make it a more 'fully bodied' server would be appreciated.

Pat
