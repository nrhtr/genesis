&gt;But the core reason they havn't been implemented yet is because most
&gt;systems are rather inter-dependant.  If a change is made to the parser
&gt;it may break commands--so while you could just upgrade the parser
&gt;module, all commands would then be broken--would you have to go out
&gt;and grab all of the varied command modules as well?  Then you'd also
&gt;have all of your custom commands too...  Are the benefits of all the
&gt;work to create this worth the pay-off?

I think each package just needs a clearly defined API, and stick to it once
the package is incarnated.  So initially yes, this could break some
systems, but the eventual payoff is that all those broken pieces, when
fixed, will now interoperate with any other system which is using those
packages.
