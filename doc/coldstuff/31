&gt;In other words, you want a method on one object to change variable
&gt;values on another object (it's children).
 
Not exactly.  I think he just wanted unchanged values to reflect the
 -current- value of their parent, and not the original.  I don't know
 if you're familiar with MOO clear-properties, and excuse me for
 seeming condescending if you're not, but it's kinda like a 'clear'
 property is just a hole.  When you want to access its value, you just
 keep falling down levels of inheritance until you find something that
 is NOT a hole (ie: the parent which defines the property, or some
 sub-parent which has changed it).
 
Clear props are quite useful on MOO.  Manytimes you want to change the
 default values of a parent's property, without bothering children
 which have already customised it.  So--you just set the parent and
 all the clear kids use that new value.
 
I think it was more a memory issue on MOO, since these 'holes' take up
 no space, but it's a neat feature of the language as well.
