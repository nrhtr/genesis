&gt; Brandon in his last notes says something about removing the

&gt; very difficult to implement most classic forms of Muds without them.

There is no compile_object() or decompile_object() function available in 
ColdC _now_, so I would not be removing that.  I already have removed the 
ability to automatically compile from a textdb to a binarydb from the 
interpreter to an external program.  This removes a bit of cruft from the 
interpreter and also gives the ability to expand quite a bit on what is 
acceptable in the textdb format (such as preprocessing and broken lines,
read notes-format in the latest release).

However, as to your question, the reason I havn't considered it a problem 
is because you have the ability to fully decompile a binary db, in-db.  
Infact, ColdCore includes some routines for decompiling the db (none for 
compiling though).

When file operations are fully functional, I will hack up a db object 
which will compile by object with most of the functionality of coldcc 
(it'll understand all).
