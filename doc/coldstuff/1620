Hey Y'all -- anybody home?

Brought up a reasonably clean-slate system using the
stable Genesis and ColdCores I just downloaded yesterday,
got into the system, let it sit a bit as I went away to
watch my wife in surgery, and when I returned, saw the
following:

mv: binary.bak: No such file or directory
tar: binary-1Sep100: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
/bin/cp: binary-1Sep100.tar.gz: No such file or directory
/bin/cp: binary-1Sep100.tar.gz: No such file or directory
/bin/cp: binary-1Sep100.tar.gz: No such file or directory
/bin/cp: binary-1Sep100.tar.gz: No such file or directory

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, but now, for example,
as I wander through the tutorial, I've tried doing "look at
the graffiti" and I am being told

Database is not readable by sender.

During the attempt to build the active database I saw, at the
end of the build, the following:

. . . . 
[a great deal omitted above]
Database compiled to "binary"
Closing binary database...
[1 Sep 2000 13:05] MALLOC WARNING: free(): freeing wrong page.

The server came up and all, and I could connect to it, but
I feared Malloc might have been a problem.  I tried building
both with and without the PHK malloc option.  This same MALLOC
WARNING came up either way.

Any suggestions?

Cheers,

Jay
