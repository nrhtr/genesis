&gt; I don't believe that control characters in MUD output would actually "break"
&gt; most clients per se.  The point is that if you allow anyone to put control

	that depends on what you define as "break".  tf line wrapping
breaks, as thus works by counting characters.  ^[[5m is 4 characters,
but they don't show up on the screen, so a line with one of those
embedded wraps in the wrong place.

	This discussion has been had, many times, on rec.games.mud.*.
ANSI escape codes are _not_ a good thing to put into the server.  If
you want to do color hiliting, etc, have a flag the player can set
which enables this, and have him load triggers into his tf, which
supports color hiliting in the later version.  Basically, design a
protocol so that the server can send display independant information,
and the client can translate this into whatever is appropriate
behaviour for the local display.
