&gt; 3) natives vs functions

This is sortof misleading :)

They are not 3x longer, they are a bit slower on startup than
functions--however once they start executing they are the same 'speed' as
functions as they are simply executing native C code.  The slower amount
on startup is in the 2-3 times range, but its measured in about a
hundred-thousandth of a second.  Using it in general is ok--but as he says
if its in a tightly executing loop where you want to optimize things,
using 'strlen(str)' over 'str.length()' will give you a few microseconds
more :)
