Well, if the format of time sent to the log is an in-db option,
i.e. run-time, then anything that hacks where that format is
determined can change it, which I dont like. Like I said though, I'm
just being paranoid. an example would be, say you have the format
somewhere, and our happy hacker somehow manages to make it "", then we
lose time info in the log. I pretty much am clueless on alot of cold
stuff, as you probably already know ;) so I'll be nice instead of
paranoid and assume that theres no way to remove info from the log
once its there, barring hacking the account the server is running
under. Since this is the case, lack of time info is not as crucial,
but i'd still prefer it to be a compile option rather than an in-db
format. 

Also, with the in-db format, wouldnt you have to get time, format it
and then log it? in this case someone can step in and mess up the
procedure. (and i also dont know how this would interact with some of
the server level log messages)

That is somewhat what I meant by time being moved in-db. Yes, its
still obtained from the same original machine source, but once its in
db, its just a string. The less opportunity someone has to get between
the machine's clock and the log, the better, i think. 

In conclusion I conclude that your conclusion is conclusive.

Ow.

uh yeah option in config.h or makefile ;)
