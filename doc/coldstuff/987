The home page explains a little bit about how it works, however, all of 
the mailing list has been archived since I took it over, if you want this 
archive as a single dump it is the year-to-date file for 1996 (even 
though it goes earlier than 1996).  There is a YTD.txt file in each 
year's directory (only one at the moment ;), this is the one you want.

Also, if responses seem extremely slow, help is in sight.  The machine 
driving '(ice|ftp|www).cold.org' (and just cold.org) is a small 486DX2 
with 8MB ram (running the Cold Dark, amoungst other things) in FreeBSD.  
Monday new RAM arrives :)
