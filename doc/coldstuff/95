&gt;&gt; The only pro for using vt codes is that it is a KNOWN standard.  Far as I
&gt;&gt; know there really is not a very wide spread standard for anything else...
&gt;
&gt; Such a MUD presentation protocol needs to be designed by somebody who
&gt; has the time and energy and ability to actually implement it and
&gt; maintain it and collaborate in discussions about the protocol spec as
&gt; they arise.  Just specifying a protocol without some concurrent
&gt; experience in implementing it isn't a good way to do business.  The
&gt; devil is in the details.

I personally would just begin by making non-hidden equivalents to all the vt
codes, people know how to use them, etc.  From there you can modify and do
whatever to customize the standard.  As for the experience bit, this depends
upon what you would call concurrent experience, i myself have played around
with vt and control characters quite a bit.  I find them extremely fun to play
with, in relation to 'ascii-art' check out the newsgroup some time and look at
the animations to see what i am referring to, but it is a real medium to use,
and there is a set standard which you CAN use in this medium.

&gt; Note that Greg has not volunteered himself to be the protocol
&gt; designer; this is wise, given that it's the sort of project that would
&gt; end up taking a large amount of time. 

Exactly, which is why it makes no sense whatsoever to NOT use an established
standard which works perfectly fine--IF there is nobody working on creating a
standard.  So a few clients may wrap a little soon, BFD--turn off graphics
mode.  My argument lies in that there IS no standard to follow, if there is, or
will be soon, I would be more than happy to use it and completely forget about
ANSI codes.  But I dont see one coming up soon, and I enjoy toying with ansi
codes, so I would like the capability in the server...
