Last night I was playing around with $player and $storyteller.
I didn't know the right way for a user to become $play so
I used @chparent and then I was able to @sheet and see the
stats.  I then used a $admin char to set one of the 
the attributes, checked it with the $player char and everything
seemed fine.

..ok here's the short version...
at some point i realized that the $player couldn't see the room
or do look or even @who.  I also tried with the $storyteller.
I even destroyed the test char and tried again.  When I
@chparent to $user, everything was fine again.

First I thought $player was working fine until after I changed
the stat.  I could have been wrong because I could never
get the $player to work right again, even on another server.

What do I need to do to make $player work right?  Same
would be true for $storyteller.  I realize that these objects
may not be complete, but since they inherent $user they should
be okay to play with.  Am I wrong?
