&gt;Please tell me if you want anything else added, especially if it's
&gt; not backward-compatible.
 
I would -really- like to see some regular expression matching
 eventually.  This is really the only thing I'll miss about MOO.
 
I use regexp extensively in my Almost Human Bastard (AHaB, mud-AI),
 and I'm sure others have used it in their robots.  It's really
 indispensable for intelligent non-player characters.
 
I plan on persuading some people I'm developing for to use Coldmud
 instead of MOO, but one of the things they really liked was AHaB.
 
Any chance on getting regexp on or before 1.0?  I realise it's a
 big addition (tho I don't realise HOW big--I'm no server wiz), but
 would appreciate at least an estimation of the likeliness it'll
 ever be in coldmud.
