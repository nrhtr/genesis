&gt; I was under the impression names were different than dbrefs.
&gt; name:  $funky_chicken
&gt; dbref: #1234
&gt; so changing get_name(); to get_dbref(); is not necessarily a good idea.

I'm not sure how greg has it, the whole thing looks rather confusing/messy
whatever.

Right now I would like "id" for one reference and "dbref" for the other
(interchangeable, although I think dbref should be $reference), but the more I
think about it, using "name" in the core is just a bad thing, as it confuses
the hell out of some people and can also be mis-understood by a few (MOO'ers. 
I dont care if this isn't MOO, or of MOO isn't everything, a majority of the
people who will be using our core will come from MOO).  I'm eventually going to
structure CDC like:

$vr object:
     ,id 'chair_234
   ,name ["chair", "blue", 'informal]

or non-$vr would just have ,id.  And ,name is "vr_name", where you parse the
elements depending upon how they want the name (i.e. "the blue chair").

(I will use 'id' for now (sigh)).
