Hello!

As has already been posted, this is indeed on the feature list for a 
future release of Genesis, however, none of the coding has yet taking place.

As a quick aside, the current stable version of Genesis is 1.1 with the 
current development version of Genesis being 1.2, which will maintain 
compatibility with 1.1.  The primary goal of 1.2 is to improve the quality 
of the codebase, primarily through optimization and documentation.  While 
some new features will debut in 1.2, anything that requires some changes 
to the driver/database interface will be in the 1.3 development tree.

I want to see full support for internationalization and localization in 
1.3.  This is a lot of work however, and work on 1.3 isn't going to begin 
for at least another couple of months while things progess with 1.2.

If you are interested in working on support for unicode or localization 
features with me, I'd be happy to talk with you, either via email or if 
you wre to visit the Cold Dark.  I had done some exploratory work to make 
all strings be 8 bit clean, that if it were re-done in the 1.2 tree would 
simplify the process of adding unicode support to a custom version of 
Genesis for now.

&gt; Command is exist only QUIT in MinimalCore.
&gt; And I was modify source in MinimalCore as "QUIT" ---&gt; "Korean Character" (
&gt; 2Byte Character ) 
&gt; But, Every 2Byte Character is eliminated,
&gt; 
&gt; How Can I use the 2Byte Character ?
