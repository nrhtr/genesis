Sounds good.  Do you ever sleep?

Btw, if anyone cares, I'm no longer a neutral observer of the Cold
server.
I've set up a site at blackrabbit.mudservices.com 1138 and naturally
I don't know how to do a lot of stuff yet.  The concept is simple,
it's a (imaginary) virtual world studio.  It will actually be the
home for my mail list people (vworlds-biz) and a demo site for some
visitors, including some game people (i.e. people in the game publishing
business, not the computer business).  If anyone on this list also
would like to demo their site, let me know and I will put together some
world tour. The demo can be anything game related, but not static.
Something has to happen; that's why robots can be interesting.
You could script scenarios and run it like a play. (you probably
could do the same with TF or tintin++, but that would be cheating,
wouldn't it?).

Come visit me.  If you are a good writer and designer, maybe you
could help me work out a better building design and write up.
I'll buy you pizza or something.
