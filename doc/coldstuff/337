&gt; You could technically create a method to allow admins to write to
&gt; the file system by having a series of scripts called where they have
&gt; 1 line send through the argument line, which is then concatenated
&gt; onto a file (or whatever).

&gt; Just thought I'd let it be known that if somebody was desperate
&gt; enough the loophole is actually there to write to the system, it
&gt; just takes an incredibly complex process.

Can you write a script from cold? or does it (as i hope) need to be
written outside and then installed in the scripts directory (which
should be the only directory you can run a script from)

Is your series of scripts what allows writing to the file system, or
is it the server? (I could probably write a script that when invoked,
connected to the mud as a player, listened to everything said, and
wrote it to a file, or whatever you want, so I dont see why your
limited to one line, bit I dont fully understand how scripts work with
Cold.)
