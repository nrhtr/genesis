okay, I understand that, but I have a question...  the tick model was
devised to control the number of tasks scheduled, if I understand
correctly, and this does result in a conservation of resources.  would
there be any expedient to modifying the model such that objects only listen
to it when it is important that they do so-- according to the same rules
that they would bother to run their own heartbeat.  the only way I can
think to do it off the top of my head is to have a list of listening
objects, who perhaps even listen only at various intervals.

would that have a positive effect in any sort of database, large or small?
would it be more trouble than it is worth?

I hope it will be at least the seed of a useful idea if not a useful idea
in itself...

Thanks for listening,
Ira
