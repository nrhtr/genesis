I've been looking at the $motd code, trying to find a
simple way to customize it.

One way would be to take $motd.build, and instead
of passing $motd.build('default) as the logon screen,
construct a custom message. My first thought was
to do:

$motd.build('title, 'driver, "", "A brief explanation 1", "more 
   explanation2, "");

However, this didn't work as all strings are translated to
"" when used as output. This means that either we need to
change the code to allow non-null strings, or program 
in additional cases (such as 'disclaimer, and 'introduction)
to add to the case statement.

One addition that might be helpful would be the presence
of a default_motd property. That is, when 'default is passed
as the argument to $motd.build, it takes the list from default_motd
as the args. That way, it's easier to customize to the needs of
a particular world.
