&gt; I tend to agree with the others--they are asking for quite a bit as a
&gt; donation :)
&gt;

Yes.

&gt; However, I can provide ice.cold.org as a replacement for Black Rabbit when
&gt; the need arises, if no sponsor has come forward at that time (basically to
&gt; extend the proof of concept period).
&gt;

Thanks.

&gt; We are working on a performance test of cold, using a robot Neale Pickett
&gt; has created which acts out a play, creating one connection per actor.  We
&gt; are going to setup several of these at various remote points around the
&gt; net, each in different rooms on the Cold server--testing performance at
&gt; each level of connectivity.  Unfortunately my 533mhz alpha is down for the
&gt; moment, so we will just be restricted to testing it on ice (120mhz cyrix
&gt; 6x86 with 32mb ram).
&gt;

I can run a few connections if you want.

&gt; &gt; Another concern is the use of the web.  I'm still not clear on this
&gt; &gt; requirement, but I know that they want to tie it in to their web page
&gt; &gt; some way.  If you look at the NBC web page, you will see that they make
&gt; &gt; heavy use of web technology, including lots of javascripts, and maybe
&gt; &gt; even java.  I don't really know what to do about this part.
&gt;
&gt; It is very VERY easy to integrate things into the web from cold--and for
&gt; ColdCore there is already a very comprehensive, modular and easilly
&gt; extendable foundation for doing so.
&gt;

I hope so.  Naturally the other concern is bandwidth, but there are someways
to steal bandwidth from the NBC web servers, however I don't think
the server(s) have much bandwidth left as it is.
