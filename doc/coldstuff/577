&lt; Actually, I only proposed := when we were discussing assignment-expressions in
&lt; the first place.  If we don't have assignment expressions, I really don't see
&lt; that it matters much one way or the other, and don't really see why we should
&lt; bother changing it anyway..

Yeah, that is pretty much the way I'm starting to look at it.

&lt; (at least most people recognize := from pascal and so can guess at what it

Actually I think of VMS symbols before I think of pascal (along the same
lines, but as  'sym:==value').

As I see it there are about as many people for assignments as there are
against it, so we should just scrap that discussion for a while, and we can
probably toss the ':=' one, unless somebody wishes to add in assignments as
expressions (at which point I think they should be ':=').
