The legal concerns are such that is probably best that you make the crypt
a seperate module that has to explicitely be gotten. You then have a group
of people outside of the states also write a module with whatever
encryption matters (without looking at your source code) and supplying it
with their version. 


&gt; 
&gt; I doubt we can ship DES (like it would matter).
&gt; 

Sadly I dont think so UNLESS you you like use the version from 
Australia.. what happens then is that you are using their libraries at 
compile time and it is up to the users of the Cold to have gotten it.

&gt; Can we ship MD5 internationally without reprecussions?
&gt; 

Hmmm I see that GNU ships md5sum in their textutils package... so 
possibly. 

&gt; What is SHA-1?  Can we ship it internationally etc?
&gt; 
&gt; What does MOO use for string_hash()?  Is it as good as MD5 or others?
&gt; 
&gt; Source?
&gt; 
&gt; I can shag md5 from the FreeBSD distribution, if I can get some factual 
&gt; information about shipping with it..
