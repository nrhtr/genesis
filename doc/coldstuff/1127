&gt; &gt;You may be out of luck--the older SunOS has some problems and is not
&gt; &gt;ANSI/POSIX standard, which Genesis assumes your compiler is.  My
&gt; &gt;suggestion would be to hitup the administrator to upgrade to Solaris or to
&gt; &gt;install NetBSD on it, both of which are ANSI and mostly POSIX compliant
&gt; &gt;(enough that it doesnt matter anymore).
&gt;
&gt;         What C compiler are you using?

I'm using gcc... here's what the latest version of Genesis comes out as...
I seem to remember that the older ones which I tried before got MUCH
farther before failing. This was done with the Web module out as I thought
that may avoid extra problems.

(4:45pm) merlin [~/Genesis-1.0p18]&gt; make
cd src/; make
yacc -d grammar.y

 fatal error: too many terminals, limit 300, line 197
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `grammar.o'
Current working directory /u2/home/jc/Genesis-1.0p18/src
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'

Shall I try another version? Which one?

Oh yes... /bin/jc/ doesn't even exist (jc is the uname I'm using to compile
it, though I've tried others).

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
