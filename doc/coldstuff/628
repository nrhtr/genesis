It'd be nice if cold supported floating point, even if only as a compile-time
option. As I understand, it has this capability, but it is unimplemented.
It would be nice if we had someone who would take charge and make all the
changes we all agree upon. Someone who everyone agreed upon, who was
wel familiar with coldmud and C, and who had the time and energy. Any
volunteers?
