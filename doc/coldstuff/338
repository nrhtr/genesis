&gt; Can you write a script from cold? or does it (as i hope) need to be
&gt; written outside and then installed in the scripts directory (which
&gt; should be the only directory you can run a script from)
&gt;
&gt; Is your series of scripts what allows writing to the file system, or
&gt; is it the server? (I could probably write a script that when invoked,
&gt; connected to the mud as a player, listened to everything said, and
&gt; wrote it to a file, or whatever you want, so I dont see why your
&gt; limited to one line, bit I dont fully understand how scripts work with
&gt; Cold.)

All run script does is run execv() with whatever you feed it, and it checks to
make sure you are running it from the scripts directory.
