&gt; the db could perhaps call set_objname_lookup('objname), to set it to
&gt; lookup on 'objname variable defined on root, or set_objname_lookup(0), which
&gt; would shut it off...

&gt; Does this repulse/appeal to anybody?  This would definitely simplify a

Um, it repulses me ...

Either have the driver keep track of it, or have the lookup in the DB.  
Don't try to combine them in such an odd way.
