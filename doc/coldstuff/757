&gt; I would like to make both work the same, because if done right there really

&gt; just mean that every iteration of the main loop it would read a block in

Methinks this would maybe spam the server just a LITTLE BIT.

A Cold server is pretty fast as VESes go, but I seriously doubt it could 
keep up with a SCSI HD.  Probably not even a streaming tape.

The only thing that even lets Cold work like this with connections is 
that they tend to be a) comparatively slow and b) idle a lot.
