I am trying to think of other uses for the driver, than just as a mud.

One use I did have in mind, and although cold probably isn't the best way
to do this it would still be fun, is to write a full fledged httpd with it.

I figure using that as a base would give the fileop's a good enough
workabout.

BTW, it would still restrict file reading to a specific section of the
filesystem (and we could even restrict following of symlinks).
