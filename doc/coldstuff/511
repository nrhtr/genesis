In-Reply-To: &lt;9411012329.AA00563@riverheights.declab.usu.edu&gt; from "brandon@riverheights.declab.usu.edu" at Nov 1, 94 04:29:49 pm

A couple of quick kibbitzes (and how I'll end up doing things if people don't
have strong objections):

&gt; conn_object.connect()  =&gt; .connection_started('inbound, "ip", port, socket)
&gt;                        =&gt; .connection_started('outbound, "ip", port, socket)

I think to be consistent with open_connection()/close_connection()/etc, this
should be renamed to .connection_opened (and likewise, .connection_closed, etc)
and in order to be more consistent amongst all of the methods, rahter than
'inbound and 'outbound it should be 'local or 'remote, indicating the origin of
the event, thus .connection_opened('local, "ip", port, socket) would indicate
an outbound connection (i.e. initiated by the local system) and 'remote would
indicate an inbound (initiated by the remote) connection, and
.connection_closed('remote) could also be used to indicate the other end closed
the connection or .connection_closed('local) would indicate that it was closed
with a call to close_connection() locally, etc.

&gt; conn_object.failed()   =&gt; .connection_failed("addr", port, socket)

I'm kinda thinking that all the net-negotiation calls to objects should have a
standard call syntax, thus this would be .connection_failed('local, "addr",
port, socket), (though I can't think of any situation where it wouldn't be
'local, but just so the args are similar to _opened and _closed..  Actually,
now that I think about it, maybe that spot should be used to indicate
why the connection failed ('refused, 'timedout, etc).)

&gt; Make assignments with ':=' rather than '='.  This is _NOT_ to make it closer

I'm not sure whether I'm going to do this or not, actually.. if assignments
can't be used as expressions it's really more of a cosmetic matter anyway, and
'=' is more C-like (and thus more familiar) to many people..  Anyway, it's
still up for discussion as far as I'm concerned..

&gt; As long as the idea is to keep code linear rather than horizontal, I would
&gt; like to see '-=' and '+=' added.  They add a touch of simplicity and as
&gt; long as a statement cannot be an expression they do not add much more
&gt; complexity.

I kinda agree with your argument, but at the same time I also don't like += and
-= very much for other reasons.  For one, they're much more cryptic than the
spelled out versions (which is one thing I detest about C), and not immediately
obvious what they mean to a newbie to programming, and secondly I just don't
like those symbols very much for those operations in general (just an aesthetic
thing, but if it's short for "x = x + y", why is the '=' after the '+'?)..

As for your other message:
&gt; The reason I would like to have it handle it's own logfiles, rather than
&gt; redirecting stderr is primarily out of personal preference (it feels cleaner
&gt; to have coldmud do it itself, and isn't much harder).

I disagree.. since there's nothing else the server is using the stdout and
stderr for it makes it much more flexible to send its log out that way because
then it can be piped or redirected to anything easily and simply (as opposed to
having to hack the server if you want to send its log somewhere else).  I
suppose this could be added as a command-line option, but I certainly don't
think it should be the only way the server can do things..

&gt; If -r coldroot is not specified in the arguments, it would default to "../".

This sounds like a bad idea too.  For one thing, this combined with the
&lt;root&gt;/bin directory name might indicate to some that the proper way to do
things is to put the coldmud driver into the bin directory and just execute it
as 'coldmud', which seems bad considering that's where execute() looks for
runnable things..  Why exactly should the default be .. instead of .?
