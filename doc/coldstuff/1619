Hello!  Just wondering if this is an active list.  If not, is there an
active Cold list out there?

also, are there any resources for MOO vs. Cold re functionality and/or
efficiency?  Im talking server here, with a minimal db, rather than the
standard cores out there.

also, are there any benchmarks, or can anyone speak from experience,
about Cold scalability in terms of connections, processor speed, code,
data, etc?

Im trying to figure out how many active connections can be managed
efficiently (e.g. without server lag) given a fairly large 'driver' ( i
think it is called ) on a Cold implementation running with a given
amount of CPU and RAM.

any thoughts or pointers?
