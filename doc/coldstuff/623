&gt;&gt; Its quite possible that there are more efficient ways to do what I
&gt;&gt; am doing, particularly in the resetting of a clock callback.  If
&gt;&gt; someone can suggest better code, Ild be more then happy to use it.

&gt; looks okay, but I think you can make it a bit more efficent in the
&gt; average case by keeping the list of callbacks in order from soonest
&gt; to latest - this changes your check each tick to O(1) (ie constant
&gt; time to check to see if just the first thing has happened yet) at
&gt; the expense of making your inserts O(n) with n the length of the
&gt; list.  Average insert case is then actually O(n/2), but who's
&gt; counting?

Probably the most efficient way of doing this is to use a heap, the
same data structure used during a heap sort.  A heap is an array
organized such that (assuming you're interested in the least element,
and the array is one-based):

	A[i] &lt;= A[2i]
	A[i] &lt;= A[2i+1]

(There are similar versions for zero-based arrays, or when you're
interested in the greatest element.)  You can think of the heap as
representing a tree, where the parent of a node A[i] is A[floor(i/2)]
and the children of a node A[i] are A[2i] and A[2i+1].  Then the value
at a node i is always less than or equal to the value of its children
(for those children which exist).  It's obvious that the first element
of the heap (A[1]) is the least value, which is nice for a timer
queue.

To insert a node into a heap, you put it at the end and then swap it
with its parent until all the heap constraints are satisfied,
propagating it up the tree.  Deleting a node is a bit tricky; you
remove it from the heap, swap the last element of the heap into its
place, and then you have to decide whether to propagate it up the
tree, repeatedly swapping it with its parent, or propagate it down the
tree, repeatedly swapping it with its child with the least value.  If
you're deleting the first element of the heap, then clearly you're
propagating downwards, so it's a little bit simpler.

The time characteristics are:

	Insertion		O(lg(n))
	Deletion		O(lg(n))
	Checking first value	O(1)

Since every timer is inserted once and deleted once, this yields a
time of O(lg(n)) for the life of a timer.  Linked list or ordered
linked list methods yield a time of O(n) for the life of a timer.

This may seem like a lot of theory, but it doesn't actually require a
lot of code.  (If you look at the timer functions in $sys from Cold
World, you'll find that they implement a heap where you can only
remove the first element, and they're two five- or six-line methods.)
Here is some C code for a timer module I wrote to replaced a linked
list implementation in a messaging server here at MIT:

/* We have three operations which we need to be able to perform
 * quickly: adding a timer, deleting a timer given a pointer to

 * heap is an ideal data structure for these purposes, so we use
 * one.  The heap is an array of pointers to timers, and each timer
 * knows the position of its pointer in the heap.
 *
 * Okay, what is the heap, exactly?  It's a data structure,
 * represented as an array, with the invariant condition that
 * the timeout of heap[i] is less than or equal to the timeout of
 * heap[i * 2 + 1] and heap[i * 2 + 2] (assuming i * 2 + 1 and
 * i * 2 + 2 are valid * indices).  An obvious consequence of this
 * is that heap[0] has the lowest timer value, so finding the first
 * timer to go off is easy.  We say that an index i has "children"
 * i * 2 + 1 and i * 2 + 1, and the "parent" (i - 1) / 2.
 *
 * To add a timer to the heap, we start by adding it to the end, and
 * then keep swapping it with its parent until it has a parent with
 * a timer value less than its value.  With a little bit of thought,
 * you can see that this preserves the heap property on all indices
 * of the array.
 *
 * To delete a timer at position i from the heap, we discard it and
 * fill in its position with the last timer in the heap.  In order
 * to restore the heap, we have to consider two cases: the timer
 * value at i is less than that of its parent, or the timer value at
 * i is greater than that of one of its children.  In the first case,
 * we propagate the timer at i up the tree, swapping it with its
 * parent, until the heap is restored; in the second case, we
 * propagate the timer down the tree, swapping it with its least
 * child, until the heap is restored. */
