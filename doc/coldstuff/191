As many can attest, I get really hung up on naming things, I like to get names
set from the beginning, so they "work" with each other (and do not conflict),
etc.  Because of this i'd like to request a few builtin's change names slightly
(not a big deal, but heck, it makes more sense this way (I hope)--if it was a
really big deal I could just change them myself, but i'd like release
changes...).

Bear with me 8)  I may also put a few Core parameter/obj name changes:

  Current                      Adjusted

Object names (dbrefs/vr/etc):
  get_name()             =&gt;    get_obj_name()
  assign_name()          =&gt;    assign_obj_name()
  deassign_name()        =&gt;    deassign_obj_name()
  ,name                  =&gt;    obj_name
     (this makes much more sense, in relation to ,vr_name)
  $sys.assign_name()     =&gt;    $sys.assign_obj_name()
  $sys.deassign_name()   =&gt;    $sys.deassign_obj_name()

Connection stuff (the names/methods called get really confusing right now):

  This is the major stuff i'd like to change.  There are several ways we could
approach it, but right now the builtin 'connect()' opens an outbound
connection, yet the server CALLS a method named 'connect' on an incoming
connection object (whatever its bound to).  Basically, the following names are
just near guesses, but they are aligned with the inbound/outbound idea...

  conn_assign()          =&gt;    conn_assign()   (this one doesnt need to change,
                                                as it works either way...?)
  connect()              =&gt;    out_connect()

The server has a few method names which must exist (on a connection, in/out):

  .parse()               =&gt;    .inbound_buffer()  (?, buffer_in()? hsm)
  .connect()             =&gt;    .connected()      (it goes both ways, but
                                                  is only called once)
  .disconnect()          =&gt;    .disconnected()   (same as above)

  From here I can hack up a good $network object (parsing ALL outbound network
connections through it, rather than $sys).  The main irritation is .connect()
where you would expect .connect() to call the builtin connect() (if only 1
change were made, i'd request it be changing .connect() to .connected()).

I know I have other stuff, in relation to buffers (Crag hacked up a
$utilities/$buffer object, sorta fun).
