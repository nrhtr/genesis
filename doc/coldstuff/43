&gt; I'd like to cast a vote of in-server regexp routines.  

...cast a vote????  This is Greg's baby, he can make the decisions, no voting
involved.  What we have to do is convince Greg :)

(Sorry, with NetrekII that is a peeve of mine--when non-coders decide they can
just randomly vote on something and make you do it).

&gt; Could someone give me a clue on what a "client robot" is?

It is something on another machine which runs a character.

I dont understand how Greg would want all automaton's to be clients though,
what about the hundreds of creepies, merchants, npc's, etc?  Are we just going
to reconnoiter our entire campus of computers to run the MUD? :)
