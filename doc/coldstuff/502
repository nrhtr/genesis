&gt; re: dumping objects with dbref instead of obnum.
&gt; 
&gt; This would be nice, especially if it allowed renumbering. 
&gt; I had some wierd cases, where I was editing a textdump that was running (doh!)
&gt; where the obnum's chaged, so that when I saved the textdump, things were 
&gt; way messed up. How does that relate to this?
&gt; (the solution was to not edit a textdump in use ;)
&gt;

Renumbering could be done in-db if create coudl be forced to use an old (free)
 number. This would only be necessary for making a core which I think should
 never have any numbrs in it anyway so I'm not too excited about that.

I think this preocupation with numbers is really silly anyway :) (cosmetic).

As for editing textdumps of runnign dbs, it is my understanding that the
 textdump is ONLY read at startup and ONLY written at execution of a
 text_dump() function. I think you only screw yourself by editing a textdump
 while the server is running.

But I could be wrong, of course...
