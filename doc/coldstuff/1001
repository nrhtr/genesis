Okay, I'd only like to reply to the 'post 1.0' introduction. I'd *VERY*
much prefer that incompatible changes are held until we have a workable
core. I wouldn't like to see core 3.0 which won't work on any existing
driver.

That said, yes, I'd like to see str.match_regexp ("blah"), but could you
wait with this till the core is done, and then both change the driver and
port the core just before the final release, so that we can develop them
synchronously?
