 &gt; &gt; If all calls to $sys.eval, $sys.compile, and all methods on $sys

 &gt; &gt; in the log.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Mmm, yoeh if mods to log were logged (besides perhaps being
 &gt; recursive?) then you'd be able to see the hole.  
 &gt; 

It seems like a good idea to run an external program on the text dump
to watch for certain types of changes to $sys, such as changes to verb
code or security related properties.  This wouldn't give you any
information on precisely when or how a change occurred, but would give
you an out-of-db method for noticing an attack that slipped through
the log somehow.

Has anyone written such a program?
