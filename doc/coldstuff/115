Well, I'm setting up a coldmud, since I got a hold of a
discless sun, and while Lambdamoo is nice, I'll try this first
to see if it's better. :)

First, Greg, your doc file was great, I tried compiling first
plain to see what the errors were, and bingo, you had the 
correction down pat.  works well.  passes the test suite.

I logged on and first thing I noticed is the annoying
messages to console.  I tried a redirect, but that didn't work.
./coldmud world &gt; log &amp;     did not stop the messages from coming
to my own terminal.  any ideas?

Third: I tried a simple command: @dig down to Sethus' Workshop
no go.  Tried again, no go.

here's the log from the third try (same results as previous)

Trying 128.84.253.18 ...
Connected to pleisto.geo.cornell.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.

Nowhere
You see nothing special.
[I typed: @dig anyway to Sethus's Third Workshop]

Created new room $room3.
ERROR: $exit.spawn called with three arguments, requires one.
Thrown by interpreter opcode MESSAGE.
~numargs in $nowhere.make_exit (defined on $room), line 8
~methoderr in $programmer1.dig_to_cmd (defined on $builder), line 10
~methoderr in $programmer1.parse_command (defined on $user), line 10
~methoderr in $programmer1.parse_command (defined on $programmer), line 12


This is basically an out of the box error.  So I figure this is worth
posting, since Greg isn't the only one who can answer it. :)

Also, the world-0.4 is pretty sparse, anyone got a decent DB built
that I can scarf up? I'm not in the mood to start from almost scratch
unless I have to.

I'm willing to create a manual for coding (since I'll be learning it at the
same time, should be a good beginner's intro by the time I get done.) so
I'm looking for as much solid stuff to build a good core as I can get.

Seth
