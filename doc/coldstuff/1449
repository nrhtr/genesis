  The Camlann server, running genesis 1.1p4, has suffered a couple of nasty
bugs.  First, invalid objects showed up in some children() listings.  One of
these was a child of $login_interface, I believe.  There were a couple of
others, but there was a crash before I could track down where they were.

  The second problem showed itself when I tried to restore the recent backups.
For backups up to a couple of months old, coldcc -d would panic and dump core,
complaining about an invalid data type.  Seems to be some sort of minor db
corruption, but the corruption existed in backup dbs up to 2 months old and it
never caused a crash in that time.
