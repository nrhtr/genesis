Okay,

I'm pretty sure I've found my problem.  Its going to take a number of 
hours to fix.  I tried to cheat and only implement 50% of the Telnet 
protocol (basicly sending, not recieving commands). Turns out that his 
works for a complete Telnet client implementation, but fails pretty badly 
for soem of the cheesier ones out there (such as both the Windows and 
amazingly the NCSA implementation.)

Anyway, a thorough implementation on my part aught to solve the problem.

Hopefully the club will be back up, and correct, on Sunday. Will keep 
all-yall (as they say in Nortenrn Fl.) posted.
