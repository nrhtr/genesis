Brandon,

	Hi, I downloaded the Genesis_1.0p22 server recently and attempted to
compile it under a Linux system running the 2.0 kernel.  I received the
following error during compilation:

	gcc -g -O -Iinclude -Imodules -c lookup.c

lookup.c: 12: ndbm.h: no such file or directory
make[1]:  *** [lookup.o] Error 1

	The header is referenced in 'lookup.c' however I can find it nowhere. 
I also downloaded Genesis_1.0p21 and Genesis_1.0p09, but could not find
that particular header in those sets either.
	Could you please help me out a little bit and either email the file to
me or point to a location where I can find it (unless of course that
really isn't the problem.)  I have read a lot of good stuff about your
server and I am very interested in trying it out.  Not to bribe your
help or anything (ok - maybe I am bribing you) but if I like the server
and find it applicable I'll gladly donate to the cause.

Thanks for your help,

Matt

PS:  I have a friend, named Steve Zdawczynski, from Tampa that moved to
Logan about a year ago.  Know him?
