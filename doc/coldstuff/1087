&gt; $dictionary_slate         -- still around for reference, somebody record
&gt;                              if they want to keep, does NOT work--out of date

This looks like Webster's dict interface. It'd be VERY nice to have, provided
someone updates it. Not the core object, but we could put it in core_contrib.

&gt; $probe                    -- Jeff artifact, anybody want to examine?

Something like puppet object. Not really useful.

&gt; $mushtoy                  -- Dancer artifact .. ?

Not for the core.

&gt; $ball                     -- Levi artifact

&gt; $help_index_driver        -- urg, what to do?  need to change driver help
&gt; $help_node_driver_...     -- ^^^^ (Miro?)

@edit &lt;helpnode&gt; to edit it. You can change node's index by calling
node.[add|del]_index (or something, check the methods on $help_node.

&gt; $base_realm               -- Miro?
&gt; $levis_realm              -- Levi?

Both are Levi's.

&gt; $user_data2               -- Anybody?  We need to convert $user_data to @set,
&gt;                              I think $user_data2 was an attempt.  Voluteers?
&gt; $jeffs_ui                 -- Jeff artifact, keep anything?
&gt; $actions_ui               -- Jeff artifact, keep anything?

Keep $actions, we'll need it (it seemed to almost work, the last I checked)
No idea what others are.

&gt; $tree_ui                  --\
&gt; $tree                     --\ Jeff Artifacts, what do to with $tree, nix?
&gt; $tree_4                   --/ still used?  $help_node_* used to use it..

@grep for these, I didn't like this code. :) Nothing seems to use it now.

&gt; $help_tree                --/

It doesn't seem used ATM.

&gt; $programmer_interface     -- uhh
&gt; $help_interface_new       -- uhh
&gt; $set_ui                   -- ehrm, how does this work with '@set' on $user?
&gt; $social_interface         -- anybody?  Beuler?

&gt; $editable                 -- \
&gt; $editors                  -- \
&gt; $generic_editor           -- \ Miro, can you list all objects that are involved
&gt; $code_editor              -- / in your editor system, we can nix the derelicts
&gt; $note_editor              -- /
&gt; $editor                   -- /
&gt; $help                     -- void object?  Does this fit in with help anywhere?

$editor_reference, $editor_session, $editor_parser and $editable should be
kept.

&gt; $settings2                -- ?
&gt; $callback                 -- ?
&gt; $message_frob             -- ?


$message_frob is used in message system, right? Dunno other two.

&gt; $climate_taobh_thiar      -- we also need a Creation climate, as Taobh Thiar
&gt;                              Isn't core, and wont exist in a core.

$climate is the parent (and uses $climate_frob).

&gt; $itext                    -- Somebody look at this.. keep/integrate or nix?

It seems useful - something like generic book (but we need to spawn a cross
between this and $thing). It can also be used for generic BBs (for people
who like the 'lookable' mailing lists).

&gt; $hook_notes               -- do we still need?  Who is doing hooks?
&gt; $event_handler            -- Who is doing hooks? convert this with hooks? nix?
&gt; $event_frob               -- ^^^^
&gt; $movement_event           -- /

Peat Young dickered a bit with these. More work is needed.


&gt; $log                      -- I dont know if I like this idea or not.
&gt; $has_reactions            -- I have notes for specs for this somewhere
&gt; $core                     -- what to do?  We shouldn't parent or list
&gt;                              all core objects anymore, just nix this obj?

&gt; $time_root{$time...}      -- need to cleanup this library

Actually rewrite is better idea. We need names for time units to be stored
somewhere, so that $time_&lt;world&gt; can have different names.

&gt; $system_object            -- used to be around for parenting 'system' objects
&gt;                              too, likely can be nixed--I'll grep.

&gt; $world/$control           -- used to focus/control the entire VR and specific
&gt;                              worlds within the VR--have not been written.
&gt;                              Sorta like '$sys' objects for each world.

Thanks for info, I'll need it for weather ticker. Perhaps I'll move the
information what was on $climate to these.

&gt; $ccp                      -- wtf?

Nothing on this object.

&gt; $heart/$scheduler         -- review, I would like to make $scheduler native

$scheduler is outdated and buggy. My suggestion is to use dictionary instead
of heap for event table.

&gt; $read_parser              -- rename/move in heirarchy, its not an official
&gt;                              'parser', it parses from the connection not the
&gt;                              user's parser stack

I'd move this to $login_connection ?

&gt; 
&gt; Then lots of Ctext Stuff:
&gt; 
&gt; $ctext2_frob
&gt; $cml2
&gt; $cml2_evaluator
&gt; $cml2_format
&gt; $cml2_format2
&gt; $cml2_telnet_format2
&gt; $cml2_telnet_format
&gt; $old_cml2_html_format
&gt; $cml2_html_format
&gt; $cml2_base_eval
&gt; $workshop_eval
&gt; $cml2_uncompiler
&gt; $cml2_form
&gt; $cml2_compiler
&gt; $cml_compiler
&gt; $cml_uncompiler
&gt; 
&gt; convert to:
&gt; 
&gt; $j_compiler
&gt; $j_evaluator
&gt; $j_bs_eval
&gt; $j_formatter
&gt; $j_telnet_format
&gt; $j_html_format
&gt; $j_uncompiler

You forgot all the ctext frobs all over the db. We definitely need a grep
that'd work on variables, not just on methods.

&gt; 
&gt; How do (the following) evaluators fit into your ctext Miro?
&gt; 
&gt; $root_evaluator
&gt; $uncompile_evaluator
&gt; $formatting_uncompiler
&gt; $compile_evaluator
&gt; $help_evaluator
&gt; $format_evaluator
&gt; $html_formatter
&gt; $base_evaluator
&gt; $place_evaluator
&gt; $prep_evaluator

This seem to be relics. Leave them for now, I'd like to steal the code.
Not that there seems to be any.
