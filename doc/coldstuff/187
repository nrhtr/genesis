paramater references, a quick discussion:

(dunno if this will answer Ray's queries, but it gives me a chance to
 chat about stuff)

Direct access to parameters is limited to methods defined on the same
 object as the the one that defines the parameter. It is done either
 by directly accessing the parameter, like a local variable, or by using
 the set_var() or get_var() builtins.

The World 6 core defines methods to view parameters for convienience's
 sake, and for actual use at times, but it is not neccessary. It is rare to
 have a method defined to set a var, as the value of the parameters is usually
 maintaned by several methods. This is especially evident where list parameters
 have add_*/del_* methods to modify them.

It was metioned that methods could be generated automatically to set/get
 newly defined parameters. This would indeed be very easy to do, but would
 not gain much, as the maintaining the validity of said parameter would be
 harder, and you'd add a lot to the size of the database having a two methods
 for every parameter.

Besides, in the World6 core, admins can modify parameters with definer * this 
 * eval. This takes care of the problem of fixing broken parameters. Besides
 that, the server builting data() allows handy access to parameter values for
 debugging type purposes.

In summary, objects have access to the parameters they define, and control
 their meanings/values. Non-standard access can be gained through data() and
 temporary methods ($root.eval()).

While I'm posting to coldstuff, I just caught wind of release 11 and would
 like to know what's in it, etc. Also, Greg, what can we as adoring fans do
 to encourage/support development?
