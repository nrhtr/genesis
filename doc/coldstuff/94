   The only pro for using vt codes is that it is a KNOWN standard.  Far as I know
   there really is not a very wide spread standard for anything else...

Such a MUD presentation protocol needs to be designed by somebody who
has the time and energy and ability to actually implement it and
maintain it and collaborate in discussions about the protocol spec as
they arise.  Just specifying a protocol without some concurrent
experience in implementing it isn't a good way to do business.  The
devil is in the details.

Note that Greg has not volunteered himself to be the protocol
designer; this is wise, given that it's the sort of project that would
end up taking a large amount of time. 

There is no quick or easy solution to this issue.  Greg is right.
