I downloaded the new core and set it up, but I am getting a (sort of
annoying) message everytime I log on.

It's the "this message will continue to appear for $admins until someone
answers all the questions" message.

Unfortuantely, I *have* answered all the questions (at least it's
stopped asking me).  Now, why doesn't it go away?

Later.

&gt; 
&gt; Ok, a new coldcore is available, along with a Core Upgrader.  If you
&gt; have
&gt; ColdCore 3.0a7 or ColdCore 3.0a8 you can upgrade to the newest core
&gt; (ColdCore 3.0a9.02).  Just grab the appropriate upgradedb tarball from
&gt; the
&gt; ColdCore ftp site:
&gt; 
&gt;        ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/dbs/ColdCore/
&gt; 
&gt; Or, you can grab a fresh a9.02 db and run with it instead.  From this
&gt; point on, we hope to have an upgrader with each core release--this
&gt; upgrade
&gt; should upgrade your database with farily few problems, assuming you do
&gt; not
&gt; change core objects.
