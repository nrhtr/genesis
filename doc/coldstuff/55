&gt; I beleive there was no problems with this, no?

Well, I do think it might be good to rename $container to something else, just
so that MOO-oriented newbies don't go around making a bunch of $containers
thinking they're box-type objects..  I'm also not quite sure why players are
descendants of $container and $located instead of simply being descended from
$box, but that's a minor point.

Also, WHAT are you going on about with the $user thing?  As far as I can tell,
everybody except you has been talking about just renaming $player to $user, not
reworking the entire heirarchy, renaming everything in sight.  What's wrong
with the following?

$person
  $user (used to be $player)
    $builder
      (etc.)
