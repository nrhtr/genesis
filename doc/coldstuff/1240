&gt;&gt; Um, 
&gt;&gt; My comment is you convinced me quite awhile back that absolute
&gt;&gt; incapsulation is a good thing.
&gt;&gt; I've never found the real need to break it, there was always a reasonable
&gt;&gt; encapsulated alternative... the ONLy time i thought itw as trouble was that
&gt;&gt; members couldn't be accessed easily for modification external debugging
&gt;&gt; tools... whiel that still MIGHT be an issue, I certainly foudn on
&gt;&gt; retrospect perfectly resonable ways to do what I was trying to do with
&gt;&gt; MUDEDIT.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I guess I'ld have to say I think its a bad ideas. I think its dilutes the
&gt;&gt; strengths of COldC-- oen of which is that it breaks your sloppy C++ habits
&gt;&gt; and FORCES yo uto learn how to write really good object orinted code.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Opinionated as always,
&gt;
&gt;But this isn't breaking the encapsulation--it is simply changing the
&gt;default value when a specific instance is not defined.  The variable still
&gt;can only be assigned-to/referenced by the defining object.  For a better
&gt;explanation I'll give the example given to me:
&gt;
&gt;$thing has:
&gt;   ,weight
&gt;   ,mass
&gt;   ,integrity
&gt;
&gt;derived is a $knife, which changes weight, mass and integrity for a
&gt;generic sword, and adds a 'sharpness'.
&gt;
&gt;If you want a specific instance of a knife you have to basically reset all
&gt;of the $thing values to be the same as $knife--when it'd be easier just to
&gt;make it a public variable (i.e. the 'default' value is that of the first
&gt;instance in the ancestor tree)--and only change what you care about.

Ah, i misunderstood, sorry. I'm very busy and doign things on teh fly here...

I do thin kthough that public makes people think of public as in C++ and
JAVA, as I did, and therefor is the wrong term.

"inherited" or "initialized" might be a better term. (I liek the latter
best as beign the clearest.)
