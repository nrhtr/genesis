I seem to be unable to get Genesis to compile on my system. During 'make',
it spits out a couple warnings, either terminating in a quota full error or
fatal error no. 1 (as I recall)... I have attempted to compile several
versions.

If anyone has any idea how, I would like to get a ColdCore up to dink
around with.
My system is setup as follows:

SunSPARC workstation (with 16 megs real ram and at least 64 swap)
SunOS Release 4.1.4_DBE1.4

I have attempted it both with a 10 meg quota and none. Neither way works.

If this is un unkown problem then I will send the output from configure and
make... I didn't want to flood the list with big huge files if it wasn't
necessary.

PS: I'm very poor at unix :(

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
