&gt; He is on the net sometimes, and not on this list and I have to forward
&gt;  stuff I think he cares about to him. (jbb@homer.ncm.com)
&gt; 
&gt; It is being debugged by him. It works. It does not have the bugs you
&gt;  (Brandon) reported. The version you have was older and _alpha_.

So why the hell isn't he on this list and where the hell is this alleged new
version?  I'm getting rather fed up with this "I'm working on it but you
can't look at it and you can't talk to me" attitude, as I suspect most of the
other people around here are too.

I appreciate the work that Jordan did to come out with the version of 0.12 that
we have at the moment and I would very much like to see what he's got now, and
since he's been the semi-official server maintainer and people said he was
working on it I've been waiting on him before tackling this stuff myself, but
I've about run out of wait and I think the least one or the other of you could
do is keep us up to date on all of this.
