&gt; Well, Ive been playign with the windows port.

&gt; First problem is that gcc under Win95 expects 8.3 filenames because its
&gt; basicly a DOS interface port of gcc (runs in a DSO box).
&gt; 
&gt; This means, with our current file names, we will NEVER compile
&gt; under gcc.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?  I coudl change the names but upgrading is gonna be a
&gt; pain. It woudl be better is we went to 8.3 for all cold source....

Uhrm, my original compile compiled everything with gcc in bash up to 
net.c, where, it bombed on some network stuff I've since finished.  I 
never did go back for a second attempt.  We never had any problems with 
filename lengths.. (perhaps bash was doing something?)
