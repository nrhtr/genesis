&gt;Subject: Re: assignment clarification
&gt;
&gt;Okay, My votes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think many readers were aware of what I was proposing but best to explain. I
&gt;&gt; believe I mentioned that I have already made the change. I have a working
&gt;&gt; server running at sensemedia.net:6666 for those who wish to see what such
&gt;&gt; a beast would feel like, or who don't believe it's possible or whatever. In
&gt;&gt; this version the operator is '='.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Having said the above it seems we now have at four questions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Should there be an assignment statement? (no, an assignment expression
&gt;&gt; is sufficient since expr; is a statement).
&gt;
&gt;I concurr that there should NOT be two different assignment operators.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If there is an assignemnt statement what should it be? (=, :=, but I still
&gt;&gt; still don't want one.)
&gt;
&gt;There shouldnt be one.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Should there be an assignment expression? (yes, if you don't want one write
&gt;&gt; lint--).
&gt;
&gt;Yes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What should the assignment expression operator be? ('&lt;-')
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;=.  Not that I think its the best idea in a vaccum, but I don't think
&gt;anything else is reasonable in a language vased on C that hopes to be
&gt;accessible to the largest numebr of users.  (See my suggested 3 rules for
&gt;compatability already posted.)
