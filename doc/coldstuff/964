I realize I promised that there would be no more changes to the base 
functions, however this one is one which was overlooked.  As it is 
generally not used in more than a few places in a DB I figured I would 
bounce it off this list for discussion.

I would like to rename the function 'log()' to 'dblog()' (which writes to 
the logs/db.log file).  This will leave it open so the logarithmic 
function can be the common name of 'log()'.  Right now all of the 
math/trig functions are named exactly as their C equivalents, except for 
log, which is 'logf()' in order to reduce conflicts.  However, this 
doesn't sit well with me...

Comments?
