&gt; I am currently considdering taking the ip and turning it into a single
&gt; integer and using objects in the database as nodes in a binary tree.  I'm
&gt; not sure how much overhead will come with the use of all those objects.
&gt; I'm also think of using nested dictionaries and a list to store the ip's =
by
&gt; hierarchical numbering based on the four number fields. I know dictionari=
es
&gt; tend to be slow, and ColdC's non-mutable datatypes can be a pain, but I
&gt; dont know what is the lesser of the two evils.
&gt;=20
&gt; Anywho, I'm off to write some code.. if someone can suggest something
&gt; better please do.

Dictionaries are not 'slow'.  They do have a large cost during
creation (adding elements) but they are quite fast for retrieval (they
are basically just data hashes).

As for new suggestions, dunno.  I just wanted to clarify :)
