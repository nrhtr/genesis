A simple yet 'elegant' (boggle) solution to a problem which has bugged me 
since MOO and into Cold presented itself to me today.  This problem is 
that it gets to be a ROYAL pain to play with strings.  For example (ColdC 
in Genesis 0.2-10):

    return "Object (" + obj.objname() + ") does not want to add " + 
           $data.unparse(int) + " to " + $data.unparse(list);

I have hacked the addition operator to do conversions when attempting to 
add to strings.  Simply put, the above (in Genesis 0.3-1) becomes:

    return "Object (" + obj + ") does not want to add " + int + " to " + list;

In combination with Genesis 0.3 being able know what your $name is, the 
above string may look something like:

    "Object ($foo) does not want to add 1 to [1, 2, 3]";

tCD running at 'cold.org' on port 1138 is running the latest version of 
genesis.  Go ahead and login and try to break things (assuming you have a 
prog bit).  It is running under a debugger, so I can get all of the nasty 
information if any 'bad' things happen.

ENJOY!
