 Excuse the pretentionism, but after playing with the "adventure.sh"
script that comes with bash [0], I thought "wouldn't it be cool if you
could do more, inside a mud-like environment.

 So, I wrote:
    http://www.RedBrick.dcu.ie/~valen/muce.ps
 as a kind of a joke. A few friends thought "that would be cool actually".
For those too lazy to read it, it's basically saying that "wouldn't it be
nice if you could run a mud-like virtual machine on your PC, and import
files from your PC (running windows, or unix, or whatever - it shouldn't
matter) as objects in a mud-like world. Then, you could clone a load of
URL objects, for instance, "go" to a friends "house" - which is a room, on
his PC, and do something like "give knapsack.urls to friend" or something.

 Anyway, I was thinking that if we were going to toy with this idea, the
Cold system might be a cunning place to start. If any of the developers
could have a look at the file, and tell me if I would be better off
starting from scratch, of from something like Circle mud, I'd appreciate
it.

[0] adventure.sh comes with the bash 2.x source distro. It's cool - try it
out - it lets you walk around your file system, picking up files into a
"knapsack", and dumping them into different directories. You can feed
files to the "rm" monster, etc.
