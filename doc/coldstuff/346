&gt; While server-based floating point support would be far faster, it
&gt; would not be exceedingly difficult to code floating point in-db.

Thats what I was thinking, too, but it seems to me that any in-db
floating point package will have quite a bit of overhead that can be
easily eliminated if a new type were implemented. I guess the question
is is the overhead enough to warrent the work the server change would
require.

A server implementation would probably have more precision for less
effort though, as well. (effort on precision, not on total
implementation)
