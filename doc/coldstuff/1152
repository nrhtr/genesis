&gt; &gt; So, logins to TcD are hosed for me, and have been for about 6 hours.
&gt; &gt; Anyone awake over there?
&gt; 
&gt;   I did a ";as $login_interface;.rehash_cache()". That seems to fix the
&gt; login problem.
&gt; 
&gt;   The 'local_cache' on $login_interface was misnamed 'local'. I have not
&gt; tracked down what caused this problem and will leave that work to others.

I got a similar problem with a player on my db. I change the objname of
an $admin (His name was a little bit too long) but the conversion aren't
made ok. Some object, like $admin, refer to it by it's old long name
instead by it's new shorter command. The commands was beginning to be
weird and I have to @destroy the player... Indead, I was steel with a
dbref who pointed on inexisting objnum.... I have to dump the backup,
correct the situation by hand (easy it was, just erase the ghost -- yes I
have a file with the good #objnum but only a dbref and a reference to the
parent $admin -- and changing the name line under the player declaration.

Hopes this can help although I think it "simply" a db corruption. :-/

Also, they're a little easy to fix bugs on $note.add_text(). De db doesn't
like to add 0 with ["a new string"] for a new note. Just check this
condition around line 12 in function set_text. I'm just begin to play with
cold but, frankly, it was extraordinary! Just missing the documentation...

Good Works Guys!
