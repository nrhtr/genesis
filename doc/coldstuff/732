This is definitely an odd one.  At some nebulous time in the past the Cold
Dark db became corrupted.  I hav not seen any pattern to it yet, but
basically strings in random locations (such as a string in a method--i.e.
a syntax message) have become corrupted, or better yet, changed in value
to a random string, such as:

    btw, I do know about Java.

This statement was given by Jeff, via normal say.  I'm assuming that
somewhere memory pointers are really getting munged.  Of all the cases
I do believe each was within a method, rather than parameters, but I am
not sure about this.  As far as the string which was corrupted, I could
see no pattern, some of the cases are:

syntax = "btw, I do know about Java.";

Where it used to be:

syntax = "cmd [options]";

Or:

return "btw, I do know about Java.";

where it used to be:

return "";

There were other strings which were corrupted, with values such as
"sticky.usu.edu" (a usu machine I use often, but which I do not know
where it grabbed the string from).

Figured I would let people know.

Oh--the only thing different I did do, was start from a binary dump
rather than a textdump (for the first time on our new machine).
