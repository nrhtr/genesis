I want assignments as expressions.

I _do_ know what I'm doing.  I write code as I write fiction.  I like it
 to look good, to read well, and I think that I as the author know how to
 best accomplish that.

I see the point of assignments NOT being expressions.  It's a fascist
 attempt to enforce a certain code style: a CS teacher reading over your
 shoulder saying, "Now Now you really meant a == didn't you?  And wouldn't
 it be better to put that assignment on a separate line, Hmm?"

I'd rather have a bit of freedom, eh?  Let ME deal with my typos.
