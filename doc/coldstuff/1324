&gt; want to become fluent in coldc so that I can edit teh db and make magic.

mmm... do you mean add a magic RPG system?   Or are we talking actual
metaphysical paranormal control?  Because, well, I hate to break it to
you, but as featured as we try to make ColdC we havn't YET figured out how
to get it to do THAT ;)

&gt; Where do I start?

Login to the Cold Dark, get a programmer character (as an admin) and start
diddling around--make a few toys, etc..

&gt; Does anyone have a specific book reccomendation?

paper-published, no.. otherwise, the ColdC Programmer's manual is good for
reference--but may be confusing for a straight read through (mebbe skim
it, then go back and read it).  Its available online at:
