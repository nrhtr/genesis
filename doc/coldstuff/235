&lt; Hold on here..you want strindex (I like that best, but let's get on with the
&lt; point) so you can do word wrapping?  Aren't we getting into the area of client
&lt; functions?  I mean, if you start putting everything in the server, you get
&lt; lambda, and you get 7 second lag and more server JUNK than you will ever
&lt; use in your entire life.  See Lambda, if you don't believe me.

I have considered this.  Basically:

  A) I strongly do not think you should limit something because another
     programmer may do something you don't agree with.
  B) The reason I have word wrapping is because of Guests.  Since I
     have the cold dark linked via telnet to the Web, guests often (and
     already have often) come in from that link.  By having automatic
     wrapping with guests it is much better.  I am personally a vehmenant
     believer in clients (I dont think you should support any form of
     telnet) and having them do all the work.

But here nor there (Oh, and strindex could be used for other things as well--I
will eventually get it, if anything I will hack it in myself--just figured I'd
bounce ideas around).
