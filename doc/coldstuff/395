I'm axing them off my account, does anybody want to take what I have and build
on top of that?

If you want to see what I have, check out:

The Manual is 1/4 finished (its taking longer because I was rewriting it).

Sorry that I'm dumping everything, but I have more "important" things to do,
such as those which make $$$ :)  (buy Darkurthe LEGENDS (this is a subliminal
message)).

Oh, yeah, the Cold Dark is shut down, I imagine it will come back online in a
few months with Jordan's core and driver, to run a Darkurthe LEGENDS MUD (and
probably one for the Harvest (Horror Role Playing at it's extreme, think
X-Files meets Chill...)).  If anybody wants the textdump it is at:

   ftp://ftp.mcs.usu.edu/pub/brandon/TCD.textdump.gz

Keep in touch
