A client robot is something like a maas-neotek robot like julia, or a
spider bot... Those are probably the most common.  They are programs
that people can run separetly from mud that go and log in like a player
and react to things that are said and stuff like that.  The reason they
are better then having things in db is that some of them, maas-neotek 
especially.  Keep track of where they've been in the db, as well as how
to get from one location to another.  If you were to store all this info
in a mud you'd end up with a LOT of info stored there...  And since
you don't have to run a bot of the same machine a mud is on this helps
if you don't have a ton of space.
