Ok, I'm new to this community, but here are a couple of my thoughts, for 
whatever they are worth...

1) Regular Expressions.
   Incredibly useful.  I don't particualrly care where or how they
   are impmented in the server, btu they shoudl be fast so you can
   use them freely.  (The most common way to build fast reg-exp parsers
   is to compile them down to an FSA.  It can take some memory, but
   runs like a champ.)

2) Load Control.
   We have a reasonable nice and clean timing mechanism in cold mud
   (heartbeat) but no way to get an indication of load.  As interactvity
   is strongly imapcted by load (mud-lag), this is important to know
   as timing of interactive things has to be adjusted as load increases.
   ( A load-sensitive timer would be REALLY neat, but not necessary, as you
     could build it in ColdC (C--,whatever you call it) if you can get
     a load-value from the system.)

Comments?
