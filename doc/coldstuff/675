Robert de Forest drew these heiroglyphs:

&gt; With all that said I pick &lt;- with no reason other than taste and the fact that
&gt;  it can't be read as 'equals' (and that it makes for a nice flow thing for
&gt;  chained assignments).

I'll just bind it to a single key in my term program anyway.  
'&lt;-' looks cool.

&gt; Private or Local methods: I would like to see a distinct way of calling local
&gt;  methods to give us the performance boost. Jordan used :foo() in his version
&gt;  but I don't like that because of MOO. What about foo()? The compiler can
&gt;  generate a local method call rather than a builtin function call if the
&gt;  identifier isn't a valid builtin.

how about -&gt;foo()?
Of course, that makes it confusing with respect to the `&lt;-' operator.

I personally have no problem with `:' and I am a hard-core MOO junkie.
But if that's too impalatable, how about ..foo()?  I personally would
find that very difficult to read, and would prefer the dots stacked
instead of side-by-side.
