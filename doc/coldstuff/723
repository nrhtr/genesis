Since this is really a ColdX issue, I've only cc'd coldstuff, lets followup
on coldx@tiny.mcs.usu.edu ...

&lt; Maybe a better solution is a general structured type mechanism that
&lt; includes sub-byte addressing.  A packet construction system, if you will.
&lt;
&lt; Does anyone have any good sugegstions for thsi (I think brandon was
&lt; playingiwth packets awhile back...)

I was playing around with the idea, still am, but I need to read up on
networking before I can go any further.  The last idea I had was to have
pre-defined (at driver compile time) packets that you would use via
a 'send_packet()' function, such as the packet:

struct update_pkt {
    int x;
    int y;
    time_t time;
};

would be set in the driver as 'update (packet_info structure), then sent
with:

  send_packet('update, [10, 234, 795727079])

And have a $network.receive_packet which would be called for each packet
received.  This is all just idle meanderings, btw.
