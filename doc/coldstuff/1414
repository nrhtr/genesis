From the doc/CHANGES file:

1.0-37 [18-Sep-97] Brandon
      * added 'partial or 'full option to $http.encode(), default
        is 'full, if 'partial is given it will only encode what
        is required for the path part of an HTTP URL (Brandon)
      * fixed fflush(): was erroring when it shouldn't be (Brandon)
      * fixed an ordering problem when .disconnect() was called, after
        a lot of urging by Jeff Kesselman ;b (Brandon)
      * fixed a bug in native .ip() -- wasn't referencing right var (Brandon)
      * added explicit close in errfile and logfile, if needed (Brandon)
      * coldcc will now whine in some cases where data isn't formatted
        correctly, with a var definition (Brandon)
      * depth search of ancestors on $root was returning [] not [$root]
      * buf_to_str*() was removing '\t' instead of translating it to a space

so...
yes.

&gt; Brandon:
&gt; 
&gt; Has that order problem with disconnect() where the message is thrown before
&gt; the socket is actually closed fixed in this release?
&gt; 
&gt; Was it fixed earlier and did I miss it?
