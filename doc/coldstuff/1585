&gt; &gt; &gt; To clarify, I'll have a $thing I've whipped up created every time a g=
roup
&gt; &gt; &gt; of players enter combat that acts as a "referee". At the end of comba=
t, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; referee object is destroyed. Now, after a year of 10 to twenty players
&gt; &gt; &gt; duking it out will Cold be able to handle it? Bear in mind I'm still =
new to
&gt; &gt; &gt; a powerful OOP environment like Cold. Please save the diesel fuel and
&gt; &gt; &gt; matches, I'm painfully aware of my incompetence with Cold. &lt;GRIN&gt;
&gt;=20
&gt; Bruce writes:=20
&gt; &gt; Why not just create them as needed and when done with the match, return
&gt; &gt; them to a pool of un-managed referee objects?  That way, if you only
&gt; &gt; ever have 10 matches at once, you only really need to create 10 refereee
&gt; &gt; objects, rather than an endless cycle of create+destroy.
&gt;=20
&gt;      Just out of curiosity, what's wrong with an endless
&gt; create/destroy cycle? =20
&gt;=20
&gt;      I'm mostly a spectator on the cold list, but this general topic
&gt; gets discussed a lot in Java circles, because object instantiation is
&gt; so expensive in Java.  The general tone, though, is that creating and
&gt; destroying would be a more elegant design, if not for the limitations
&gt; of the language environment.
=20
Because objects are inherently persistent in ColdC, they also have a
unique identifier.  This means you can theoretically run out of
identifiers since it is a signed 32bit number.

As far as overhead goes--that is more a core issue than anything.  To
instantiate an object in ColdC (without hooking into the core) is
relatively lightweight--but then no initialization occurs either.
