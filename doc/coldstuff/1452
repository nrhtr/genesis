The official repository is www.cold.org.  I believe the ftp area is reacahble
directly at ftp.cold.org.

When I have questions or sisues I suaully go to "the source" as it were and
ask the guys workign on it. Theyt can generally be found at the colddark site,
cold.org:1138

&gt;         I was wondering if anybody on this list could help point me to a
&gt; good source of information, or perhaps some pointers getting started with
&gt; ColdC.  I've been an active develpoer of MUDs, mostly diku, and merc based
&gt; for the last couple of years, but I've found them to be highly restrictive
&gt; for expansion.  I came acrossed ColdC and was impressed with it's Ideas.
&gt; I would like to try starting a MUD based on it, but have had a hard time
&gt; getting started.  Any ideas, and or pointers on where to get started would
&gt; be greatly appreciated :)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks..

&gt; Nitwit ideas are for emergencies.  You use them when you've got nothing
&gt; else to try.  If they work, they go in the Book.  Otherwise you follow
&gt; the Book, which is largely a collection of nitwit ideas that worked.
