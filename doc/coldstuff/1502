&gt;Do we want to wait until the three holes are fixed?  or do we want to convert 
what we have currently?

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  I voulnteer to do a Word to PDF translation (I have acrobat.)
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  Word is porbably the single most used word processor onm the desktop (good 
or 
&gt;  &gt;  bad, it is true.) So I think word is a good form,ato starty from.  We 
shoudl 
&gt;  do 
&gt;  &gt;  PDF though as well as straight text.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  JK
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;I greatly appreciate the changes, but one question lingers in my mind
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;... Why ''Word'' format??
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;I would love to accept updates to the document, please talk to me
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;about it online... probably monday.

&gt;  &gt;  Thought to meditate on:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite 
&gt;  different 
&gt;  &gt;  from any other two apples in the world.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;  Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
&gt;  &gt;  or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
