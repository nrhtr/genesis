I have finally answered the age old coldmud question....  what the hell
is a frob good for?

I've been re-architecting diogenes, a clean up pass and I ran into a
real object factoring problem-- frobs turned out to be the clear "right
answer".

Frobs are for when what you need is truely a new datatype, not an
object.  What is the difference?  Well, an object, if inherited N
times through n children still only gets you 1 representation of the
object.  This behavior is USUALLY eaxactly right but there are times
when it isn't, when for various reasons you either:
   (a) Want each parent to bring its OWN data store to the problem
or
   (b) Need multiple copies of the parent in a child.

In my case it was the verb-list type.  Some simople utility interfaces
(like my MUDEDIT interface) only have 1 list, but all VR objects have 2
(an "internal" and an "external" interface).

This brings up another point which is that, for code purity, if anyone
were to someday RECODE coldx, the proper way to do what we currently do
with the data-type helper objects is PROBABLy to treat ALL data types as
frobs internally.
