&gt; &gt; I didn't look too closely at this patch, but am I right in thinking
&gt; &gt; that the ?= operator is a simple test of existing value, rather
&gt; &gt; then an operation which is only performed if a variable has not
&gt; &gt; been assigned to previously?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perl has a useful:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	$foo = $bar unless $foo;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; construction, which only assigns a value to $foo if no previous
&gt; &gt; assignment has taken place.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wouldn't this be logic (expressed as '$foo ?= $bar') be more useful?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ay (prepared to be clueless...)
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO no--perl's "unless" drives me up the wall (along with a few of its
&gt; other operators).  It changes the focus from left to right to right to
&gt; left simply for the fact that then it can use a cute word rather than an
&gt; operator and it supposedly makes 'sense' as you read it. Using ?= stays
&gt; left oriented, and fits in with existing operators, and is also shorter :) 
&gt; (it also 'reads' better IMHO):

[snip]

Sure.  I don't care about the syntax and ?= is better than unless,
and I want' suggesting that a different syntax be used.  I wanted
to know if the 'if' test implicit in ?= was on the existing value
of the variable or if it was a test for wether or not a value had
been assigned to the variable.

It may be the case that it really doesn't matter which property of
a variable you test (its value, or its settedness).  In which case
fine.

Ay.
