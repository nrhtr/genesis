The new scheme for upgrading is available.  It is in beta mode, but
only because its new--not because its instable.  It bears no relation
to the previous version, and should be much easier to use.  From the
README file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the command 'upgrade'.  This is a Perl5 program.  It expects perl5
to be located in:

    /usr/bin/perl

If it is not, you will need to edit it and change the first line to
reflect where your version of perl is.  You might be able to find your
version of perl with the command 'which perl'.  Use 'perl -v' to get
the version number.

If you want to see what will be done, before actually applying the
changes, use the argument '-list' for upgrade.  If you want to see the
intimate details of what will be done, also include '-full'.  The
output from '-full' should be completely capable of being fed to
coldcc as a textdump, so you can redirect that output to a file and
make changes to it as you deem appropriate.

Once the upgrade is completed, the binary directory you specified
should be current.  I suggest making a textdump of it, then starting
genesis from the binary, connecting, and verifying functionality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be pretty simple.  You can get it at:

    http://www.cold.org/cold/dbs/ColdCore/upgradedb-3.0.1998-10-20.tar.gz

Let me know how it goes.
