Hi,
	Ok I have a working(?) version running.  I have executed quite
a few commands without any crashes.  The native "execute" method
is currently unavailable.    
I attempted to produce a diff file, but my editor has
screwed up the source with CRLF sequences.  A minor inconvenience
but one I can correct.  I also had to rename some modules to get
Borland's IDE to cooperate.  Hopefully I can figure out how to use
the project manager to allow the same "make" structure.  Unix's make is
so much nicer. :-(

My question is there any interest in my mods?
If so how do you prefer these to be packaged?
What #ifdefs should I use? __Win32__ or WIN32 and/or __BORLANDC__ ?
I had to redeclare all the globals in the defs.h as extern except in the
module
that really defines them? Does VC++ handle this differently or perhaps my
options are whacked?
