&gt; Just joined the list ( and set up Genesis 1.1p2, Cold Core 3.0a9.02 ), and have
&gt; skimmed the archives, looking for some more documentation for the Cold Core.
&gt; Some of the help nodes say, "Yet to be written", and I was also wondering if
&gt; anyone has taken notes on the object tree, or some sort of "how to" set of docs
&gt; for getting started working within Cold.

Right now, the best source of this type of information would be to drop by 
the Cold Dark and chat with us there, however, it would be best to get these 
docs finished, so if you had notes on what your questions were and where the 
documentation proved inadequate, that would assist us in improving the 
documentation.
