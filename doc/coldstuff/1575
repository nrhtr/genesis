&gt;Right at the moment I'm writing everything in Emacs and recompiling and
&gt;restarting after each change, which is hardly optimal.  I didn't have a
&gt;working user interface before this, though, so it was the only option.  :)

This is how i am working too.  For me this is best for a number of reasons.
At a  certain point I'm going to want to be able to load patches while up. 
I wrote a little parser that reads ColdC and creates and modifies the 
objects  to do this.

In the past I actually wrote a Java interface that allowed me to edit the 
database at run-time.  Its not really very hard but I havent ahd the tiem 
to keep it up. At this point i dont hink i have my old Java prgoram's 
code.  All it did on the cdoe side though as open up a socekt to an object 
in the db that listend for editor connections and minipulated objects absed 
on text commands recieved from the interafce.
