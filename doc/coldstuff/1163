Frank:
&gt; Thanks.  That's at least one reason to get Alpha 5,  Btw, I've just
&gt; started
&gt; looking at the whole database-- there's a lot of code.  Good job
&gt; to the whole crew!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at how to easy or hard it would be to implement intermud3 
&gt; 	http://www.imaginary.com
&gt; for intermud communication (the '97 buzzword huh? Connect now with 
&gt; your Sega to the to the Intermud! SEGA!!!). Anyway, if I can actually
&gt; get to the coding part, I hope to get the intermud3 hooked up so
&gt; that I can join other muds in the same network (mostly LP and a couple
&gt; Diku muds).

[feature list, snip...]

Ahem.  I'm a little piqued, to be honest, that the intermud
communitaction protocol even exists.  Mainly cuz it sucks.  But
then I would say that wouldn't I.  MOO-net did all this 3 years
ago (whine, gripe, moan...) and a lot more besides.

You can take it from me though that everything proposed for i-3 is
possible, and teaching cold all about it will be trivial.

The subtext, that LPC developers, Cold developers and MOO developers
don't talk to each other and that as a result everyone is running
around chasing their tails redesigning crap that other people
discarded years ago, does not make good reading.

And since 'tis the season, Bah humbug!

Ay.
