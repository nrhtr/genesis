&gt; assumption that means you can have as many objects as your disk can
&gt; handle,
&gt; but only 600 of 'em can be in memory at once. Is that right?

Correct, and that's if your cache size is set to that.  There's a system
out there with a database size of several hundred megs and a couple
hundred thousand objects.
