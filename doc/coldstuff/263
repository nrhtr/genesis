&lt; This is somewhat related to the ports issue... so I'll toss it in here.
&lt; Has anyone considared making something that interfaces with mud rwho servers?
&lt; Both to have the mud listed in rwho listings, and to get information
&lt; from it.

rwho is a poorly designed metaserver in my opinion.  It requires a lot of
interaction between the metaserver and each server, including having the server
send periodic updates to the rwho server in question.  All that really has to
happen is to have the metaserver connect to a port every N minutes to get a
user dump (shrug).  So it may not be up to minute, it would be a lot simpler.
