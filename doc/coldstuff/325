&gt; Any other info people can think of for a FAQ at this stage?

I'd suggest just brain storming with every question people have ever asked, we
can keep the good ones.  Greg would be a good person to spam out a bunch (I'm
sure he has had a many).  Off the top of my head:

What is ColdMUD?

Why ColdMUD?  Isn't there a CoolMUD?

How is it different from &lt;favorite mud here/usually MOO&gt;

I want a MOO &lt;or other favorite MUD&gt; to ColdMUD translator so I can convert
   my whole database over, has anybody made one yet?  Does anybody
   plan on it?

  (BTW, I'd answer this as NO NO NO NO NO -&gt; ColdMUD can do it better 8b )

I cannot get the server to work because &lt;problem, Greg, what common ones do you
                                         know?&gt;

World 6 doesn't have anything, are there any other cores?

So brainstorm...
