Correct me if I'm wrong, but 'crypt()' exists for one purpose, and that 
is handling passwords.  What I suggest is taking a step towards greater 
abstraction by adding two things:

  * a match_crypted() builtin.
  * a encrypted data type.

The key is the encrypted data type's literal representation would be:

    "ENCRYPTED"

The only way to create encrypted data would be through 'crypt()'.  When
matching encrypted data you would pass it to 'match_crypted()'.  The only 
time the actual true value of the encrypted data would be seen is in a
text dump, at which point it would be whatever is behind the scenes (such 
as DES or MD5 or whatever).

This has two advantages:

  * Abstracting with match_crypted() means you dont have problems when
    different implementations store the seed in different locations
    (such as FreeBSD and MD5).
  * Security is heightened as only people with login access to the
    filesystem can even see the true value of a password.

Basically, its like creating shadow passwords in unix..

Comments?
