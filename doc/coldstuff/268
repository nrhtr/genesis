&lt; Acutally, I fully endorse the idea of removing the time and &gt; from log()
&lt; entries and leaving up to $sys.log(). This would also mean you could put
&lt; $string.from_value(sender()) in the entry or something. This change strikes
&lt; me as similiar in nature to the change in version 11 to traceback(), where
&lt; printing the traceback is a task left up to the programmer. Likewise, log()
&lt; might as well leave it up to the programmer to supply a meaningful/useful
&lt; log entry.
&lt;
&lt; I doubt there's much to the change, prolly one or two lines in log.c. In fact,
&lt; I was under the impression that Lynx had already made this change in his
&lt; version of the server.

Yes, I did.  It is only two lines, but when we talked about it last eve most
people felt the server should tack some type of date on it (shrug).  I would
just like it smaller so it is easier to read and you can put more on a line.
