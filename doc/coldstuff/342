I've heard that floating point numbers currently don't exist in Cold and would
like to make a request for that to be added. The reasons for this request are:

	1. You could then more easily code a realistic Space Simulation or
	   other types of RL simulations in the wonderful OOP enviroment of
	   Coldmud.

	2. It would bring Cold's functionality up one big notch, making the
	   math support fairly complete, attracting more scientific/educational
	   orientated coders and developers.

	3. It seems to myself to be silly that Cold despite how *advanced* it is
	   would be unable to *do* something that primitive MUSE's and MUSH's
	   easily do.

	4. It would be yet another reason why Cold is/should be better than
	   even MOO's(which also don't have floating points as far as I know).

	5. If it were programmed *now* instead of later after the Cold code is
	   fully developed it would be an easier(relatively speaking) change.
	   I've heard that MOO's are *stuck* with no floating point support
	   because it would too much of a major change for them with their
	   'set in stone' server code.

Comments?
