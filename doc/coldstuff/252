Ok, I have a 7 hour graveyard shift tonight, and I'm bored.

Anyhow, I have a fingerd working now (nothing really, just 2 lines to a
.connect method).   Do:

telnet chimaera 6679

I will eventually get it to accept a single line string for a user before it
disconnects (infact, by the time you read this message it may already do that).

One thing this brought to mind.  I will be sinking into trivalities now, but
perhaps we should have a basic format for this port that is the same from
server to server, because I _know_ that people will personalize their @who
listing.  As far as rwho goes, I dont care: I've always thought it was a bad
way of doing a metaserver.

So, here is my first (trivial) suggestion for a format:

user:        Time On:   Idle:          Location:         Misc:
XXXXX        XXXXXXX    XXXXXX         XXXXXX            XXXXXXX

It would be nice to have a simple seperator for each column, rather than a
variable set of spaces, but feh.  Anyhow, what this would mean is somebody
would see:

-----------
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Lynx         18:42:10  00:01:00       The Pit         The keeper of the Cheese
Richelieu    17:50:12  00:12:13       The Pit
Bob          15:13:12  00:00:00       The Pit         etc
Connection closed by foreign host.
-----------

From here people can parse to whatever (blank space is because of the newline
it needs);

Anyhow (sigh).  AT LEAST ITS ABOUT SERVERS IN GENERAL! 8)
