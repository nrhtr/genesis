Encapsulation.  MOO breaks encapsulation by allowing one to inherit 
values, which is incorrect.  Cold is simply more strict about it.  It 
does cause problems when trying to code designes based off the MOO model, 
but once you get used to how it works in relation to the Cold model, it 
is actually a nice addition.
