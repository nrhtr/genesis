Personally I would like to see the manual evolve to a proper manual.  Oen of the 
good things about Coldmud was that it had a real printed manual and I'd like to 
see ColdX get back to at least that level for written documentation.  Much of
the old Coldmud manual can, and IM oshould, be canibalized to make a enw upt to 
date manual.

For function reference my folder full of html pages is adaquate but not as a 
real mana`ual I can, for instance, hand to my junior prgormamer and say "here, 
you can fidn your anseres in this."

My take is that a refernce format will continue to be only a refernce format and 
thsi it is muche asier to extract refernce from full docs than to go vice versa.

Thought to meditate on:

No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite different 
from any other two apples in the world.

Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
