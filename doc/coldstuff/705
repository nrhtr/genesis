Jeff Kesselman drew these heiroglyphs:
&gt; &gt;Your whining about "but it's not like C"
&gt; &gt;is really one of the most insignificant aspects of this whole issue I can think
&gt; &gt;of.  It was NEVER exactly like C, and it's not supposed to be!  Changing this
&gt; &gt;one operator won't suddenly make people go "oh, I could handle all the other
&gt; &gt;changes, but I just can't learn this language if assignment isn't '='"..
&gt; &gt;sheesh.
&gt; 
&gt; Youa re taking this MUCH too personally and obviously were scared by an
&gt; assignment operator at a young age.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually your mention of the fact that you never learned to avoid this C
&gt; pitfall in your earlier post explains a great deal.  MOST competant C
&gt; programmers make this mistake twice and never again.  I consider your
&gt; "whining about how it was a bad K&amp;R decision" the msot irrelevent thing in
&gt; ths dicussion.  One mans logic is another mans whining irrelevancy.  You'ld
&gt; do well to grow up and learn that if you EVER plan to do ANY programmign in
&gt; a competant group environment.
&gt; (In case you're wondreing I've been programming professionally, both singly
&gt; and in groups, for about 10 years now.)

WOO, religious flamewar! :) Actually, I make this mistake all the
time.  I can also live with it.  Especially since many compilers have
a 'possibly unintended assignment' warning that saves my ass.
Warnings can be done in-db, and turned off by experienced programmers
who don't want to be bothered by them.

The point: warnings are good.  write a db that generates them.
