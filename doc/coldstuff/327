You could technically create a method to allow admins to write to the file
system by having a series of scripts called where they have 1 line send through
the argument line, which is then concatenated onto a file (or whatever).

Just thought I'd let it be known that if somebody was desperate enough the
loophole is actually there to write to the system, it just takes an incredibly
complex process.
