A good solution to the long problem of easilly relaying internet SMTP
email to a mail host has been found by Brad Roberts with help from a few
other sources.  Essentially this requires a specific hostname which has an
MX entry pointing to the relay gateway.  Any and all mail sent to this
host will be relayed to the ColdCore (so this host will no longer receive
mail in the standard way--which is why it should be a seperate hostname).

The DNS MX entry should likely look something like:

YOURHOST  in      a       206.81.134.107
YOURHOST  in mx   0       REAL.HOST.RELAY.COM.

With the MX entry in DNS setup correctly, the next step is to configure
sendmail to accept the host and relay it appropriately. To do this you
need to setup your mailertable to recognize the host as a cold relay host.
Define cold in sendmail.cf as:

Mcold,          P=[IPC], F=mDFMuX, S=11/31, R=21, E=\r\n, L=990,
                T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
                A=IPC $h 1125

After this is defined simply add an entry to your mailer table like:

    SITENAME.SITE.COM  cold:REAL.SITE.COM

The Cold rule tells it to relay it to the specified host, on port 1125. 
The mailertable location will vary.  Look in your sendmail.cf file for:

    Kmailertable

With these installed, you should be able to receive internet mail on your
Cold server without problem.

We have decided to supplement this idea by creating a subdomain to the
cold.org domain of 'site', where anybody running a cold server can request
a name and with a minimal donation ($5 or more/year), we will create the
name and MX record for the server.  This will allow the MX to work as
above, for mail relaying, and will also allow PLACE.site.cold.org to point
directly to the specific cold server.  For instance, with the name shadows
we would create the internet hostname 'shadows.site.cold.org'.  Users
around the world could connect to this Cold server by using the address
'shadows.site.cold.org', and the MX record would also relay mail
appropriately.

In the situations where the mail volume would not be high, and the server
cannot alter its own sendmail configuration and mailer tables, we will
also be the mail relay.

If you are interested, you can register your server at:

    http://www.cold.org/servers/register.html

And I will respond with more information.
