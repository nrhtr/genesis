Traumahound wrote Interlude, I still have the source code around somewhere
from where I was poking at it.  It was not really finished, and I
believe traumahound became too busy to work on it, and it kind of
quietly faded out.  It was runnable, to be sure, though.  I can dig through
my backups and old files and find the thing and information if you want it.
