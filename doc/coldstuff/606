&lt; Greetings, I'm new to the list and to Coldmud in general.  I've put up,
&lt; well, tried to put up, a coldmud 0.12 1c server and run the Cold Dark core
&lt; 
&lt; 1.1 and have had very little luck.  I've got the server compiled and it
&lt; will start up the core.  However, some odd things are happening.  For
&lt; instance, when you connect as a guest, it gives the server a segmentation
&lt; fault and kills it.  The @prose command also does the same.  I'm running
&lt; it on a SunOS 4.1.3 machine, is this the problem?  Is this a common bug? 
&lt; I had no problems compiling the 0.10 server on a linux system.  Any help
&lt; that is out there will be greatly appreciated.

Read the file doc/README.src, it has some comments about changes you need to
make on your type of system.  Also, somebody noted that line 166 of README.src
should read:

                    list = prepare_to_modify(list, list-&gt;start, list-&gt;len + 1);

Not:

                    list = prepare_to_modify(list, list-&gt;len + 1);
