Hello,

I'm currently working on building a new ColdC core from the ground up.
It isn't based on anything in particular, really, except for the sum of my
experiences with text-based games.  I'm still pretty early in development,
but I'm starting to get some usable code.  If someone else is working on
or interested in designing their own core, they might be able to pick up
some tips from what I already have.

It's not really usable enough right now to even warrant a release, but the
source is available for anyone interested in looking.

I currently have:
Reasonably well-done network code, a flexible command parser, commands
for editing and poking code, and concept of users, places, and things.

Major things I don't have include:
Permissions and ownership (ack!), moving, manipulating things,
communicating.

Doesn't sound like much, considering that it's already over 2000 lines of
ColdC.  &lt;g&gt;  Still, it might help somebody out.  The parser and the
network code could be especially useful.  I'll do a first release when I
get to a point where people can actually create environments and play with
it.  For now, just contact me if you're interested in staring at the
textdump  (even if it does compile for you, there's no documentation
yet.  ;)

Oh... and if anybody can think of a better name for it than XidusCore,
please let me know.  I've already thought of AlbaCore, that's out.  ;)

Happy hacking,
Jeremy Weatherford
