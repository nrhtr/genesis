&lt; Methinks this would maybe spam the server just a LITTLE BIT.

Sorry, I realized after i sent that off that I said blocks.  All I intended
to do was to grab a line at a time.

Actually, we could just not allow intrusive file openings like with
connections, but let connections go both ways (trying to open an intrusive
file would throw an error).

&lt; Sending them how?  Just like net connections?

Yes.

&lt; Hm.  The answer is: neither.  Files are more complex than net 
&lt; connections, you'd want to be able to seek around in them and the like.  

But do you really?  I can see file read/write being used somewhat, but
file seeking and other higher level ops just wouldn't.  Cold is a higher
level language.  I feel that type of control is beyond it's intended
scope...

(but, hey, you never know...)
