I'm a big proponent of multi-threading.

Having said that, I now have to observe that i really havent run into the 
need in ColdX programming.  In point of fact, I've written quite a bit of 
code which has NOT been re-entrant because I knew an object woudl not be 
re-entered.

Is it a vain hope to hope that such behavior could remain the default?  
Its kind of a pain in the rear to go BACK to old stuff and try to 
remember where I made this assumption...
