&gt; Actually (cosmetic here), I'd prefer executables/ or exe_bin/, or hmm,
&gt; execute_bin/ (hsm), perhaps execute/  (sigh).

Howabout exec/?

&gt; "private" would be good too, in my opinion (would remove a lot of perm
&gt; checking which simply checks to make sure it is called by this object).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I would (still) like to see the assignment operator change from '='
&gt; to ':='.  I believe it would seriously help lessen confusion in the language,
&gt; in relation to people learning the language.

Yeah, I forgot about these two when making up my list.. both of these should be
in the "discussion" section.

Something else I forgot which should be in the "to-do" section:

In-DB message-&gt;method resolution
  Originally (in the docs at least) there seemed to be some distinction between
  a message sent to an object and the method called upon receiving that object,
  but no real advantage of this conceptual distinction was taken.  I'm going to
  add the option for an object to do its own message resolution by way of a
  specific method on the object, which the server would call, if present, to
  find out what method should be executed when a message gets sent to that
  object.  In addition to enhancing encapsulation, this would also have
  significant advantages in several areas such as doppleganger frobs and
  network-object representations.
