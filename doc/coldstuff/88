I don't believe that control characters in MUD output would actually "break"
most clients per se.  The point is that if you allow anyone to put control
characters into anything that they send to the MUD, who knows what that will
turn up like on other screens.  The MUD should _not_ allow non-glyph non-space
characters in its input.  Instead, I would suggest a mechanism for allowing
them to be input by way of manually editing text dumps, thus restricting any
applications of such special characters to sufficiently high-up people, and not
requiring an unnecessary and potentially dangerous change from the standard MUD
input conventions.

I do believe that a mechanism for utilizing them in output would be quite
useful, and sometimes necessary (as exemplified by the tab problem with MOO
Gopher clients), though.
