I like /ebin best, there are precedents for it as a Unix bin directory
name (such as /sbin, which is used in (at least) Linux) but it wouldn't
be common and invite security problems.

&gt; Yeah, I forgot about these two when making up my list.. both of these should be
&gt; in the "discussion" section.

I agree with both of these, but I also think := should be an expression.
'Vertical code organization' just doesn't exist anyhow while there are 
such things as .set_foo() methods.

I'd also like to see facilities for attaching connections and pipes to
frobs.  Making a whole new real object for things as dynamic as
connections and pipes could get real old real fast in the case where
there isn't much state to store.  Or maybe objects should just get
much cheaper and be garbage-collected, as Colin has sometimes remarked.
