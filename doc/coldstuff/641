&gt;&gt; Re: SUFFIX, PREFIX...as I see it, all you need to do is, in player.parse()
&gt;&gt; put echo(PREFIX); at the beginning, and echo(SUFFIX) at the end.  Ths may
&gt;&gt; not be a complete solution, but it's a start.

&gt; That doesn't do anything about the possibility of intermingled text due to
&gt; pause()s or suspend()s, however, which makes it pretty useless for most
&gt; applications..

Yeah, LambdaMOO is at least nice enough to output SUFFIX at the task
suspend point.  On the other hand, MOO doesn't do The Right Thing with
suspending tasks either, which is to have some sort of MIDFIX to let
the client know that output has suspended, but should resume in a
little bit.

I'm not sure how important SUFFIX et al are, if you have an MCP-aware
client and server.  (See http://jhm.ccs.neu.edu:7043/help/subject!mcp
if you don't know about it.  At last count, there are at least six
clients that speak it.)
