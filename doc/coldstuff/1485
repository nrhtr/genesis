&gt; Hello, I have a couple questions that hopefully someone can help me with.
&gt; 1) Is ANSI colors supported what so ever inside the code? I was wanting
&gt; to add color to $body.say_cmd and a few others.

As was mentioned earlier, you want to use CML/Ctext if anything at
all.  Imho you dont want to do it--that should be done by the client.
You can add triggers to nearly any decent mud client for it to
'colorize' things in certain ways.  This is advantageous because it
moves the processing to the client's CPU, instead of the server's.

&gt; 2) I recently was working with $described.description and noticed
&gt; sender() returns $the_pit or whereever you are located. Is there
&gt; something I can use to return the user like $user_soth? I'm trying
&gt; to check to see if the user has a certain flag in a variable I've
&gt; created named pflags so was wanting to check if(flag in pflags).=20

Pass the 'flags' variable to .debug().  It probably contains what you
are interested in.  Specifically, you are probably interested in the
value of flags['actor].  But there are a few others of interest.
