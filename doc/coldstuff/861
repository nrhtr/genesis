&gt;     Hello my name is Robert Lumley, I am the site admin at telmaron.com. 
&gt; I have often been interested by cold mud and have tried to find a good
&gt; source for the material, well i found it now but i can't ftp stuff.  I
&gt; tried to get the CDC-1.2.tar.gz and keep getting permission denied. Am i
&gt; doing something wrong. thanks..

The CDC core is outdated, I keep it on the archive for backwards 
reference, but it is not readable as I don't want people grabbing the 
older stuff on accident.  The latest version is ColdCore.

However, we are moving through a transition with ColdCore and Genesis 
(the db format is changing), so its mainly incompatable at the moment...
