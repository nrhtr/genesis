I'm looking for a cold coder willing to take the position of Master
Coder on a mud I'm starting. It's going to be fantasy based, and
hopefully very exciting. I have builders, a server, and a guaranteed
player base.. I just need a dedicated coder that's going to be able to
modify the code to the extent that the game requires. Please, if you'd
like the job, send me email at cold@prose.org. Thanks a bunch, and hope
to hear from some of you soon.
