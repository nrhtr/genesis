I thought I made this clear in my post mentioning 11.* before, but I guess not.

11.x is not 'released'. I am now aware of three moderately serious bugs, two
 related to cacheing, one is a problem with the use of sublist() and list
 addition.

In other words, you don't want it. It's not much better than 10, other than
 nice code changes that only a server hacker would notice. I mentioned the 
 changes to the language just so people would be informed.

As far as I know, 11.x will never be released. The next version, whatever its
 number, will be (untill further notice) written in C++, but otherwise
 identical to 11.x as far as the user is concerned. When it comes out, you will
 want to make the changes I described in order to upgrade.

This is months down the line, so feel free to work with 10.3 until then.
