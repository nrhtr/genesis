Hey all,
	I'm getting a handle on the Cold environment and I'm LOVING it. But despite
my self-assumed leap in proficiency, I beseech thee, gurus of Cold, for your
knowledge. My first question should be a simple one for you veterans:

Can Cold handle the creation and deletion of objects on a grand scale?

	To clarify, I'll have a $thing I've whipped up created every time a group
of players enter combat that acts as a "referee". At the end of combat, the
referee object is destroyed. Now, after a year of 10 to twenty players
duking it out will Cold be able to handle it? Bear in mind I'm still new to
a powerful OOP environment like Cold. Please save the diesel fuel and
matches, I'm painfully aware of my incompetence with Cold. &lt;GRIN&gt;

	My second question deals with the dictionary data type. I understand how to
use functions to reference, index, add, and delete items from a dictionary.
My second (stupid) question is this:

Can the value of a dictionary item be edited?

	To clarify, I'll have a series of "skill" objects that a player's character
will reference in a dictionary variable to reflect what the character knows.
The key would be the skill name and the value would be the skill level. Can
I edit that value like I would in a list data type?

Thanks for your time and patience, major props to all those who have helped
me out so far!
