&gt; I (used) to be on the intermud list and one thing that struck me as
&gt; annoying was their insistence on re-creating existing protocols that are
&gt; perfectly capable (just drop them on a different port or on a sub-protocol
&gt; like VEIL).  For example:
&gt; 

I believe that the I3 was developed in response to the interMOO news
postings and
the teasing that the LPC world didn't have anything like that.  By the
time
you suggested VEIL, some version of Intermud was already in place. And
you
know how hard it is to change things once there is some momentum. 
Besides
LP people don't talk to MOO/Cold people do they?

I think there is one approach that is interesting, and that is to use a
gateway server.  
This means only the gateway has to know I3.  I would much rather sit in
my Cold world and
deal with LP-related stuff through channels.  Beats having several
Windows open like I have now
and violating the laws of time and space by being at more than one place
at the same time.  

&gt; &gt; Intermud3 has the following features:
&gt; &gt;       -mudlist to show what muds are up, type, address, databases
&gt; &gt;       -remote tell with emotes
&gt; 
&gt; There is no existing protocol which would handle this well.

But it currently works for I3-- except who, that one really sucks.

I can solve problems by subscribing to channels and talking to groups
on other muds or tell them individually.  Naturally most of this
stuff is for Admins. I started using these channels when I was on the
old
TMI, then at TMI-2.  

&gt; 
&gt; Whats wrong with the current 'finger' protocol on port 79?

The difference is that everything is going through your I3 port, so that 
finger actually pulls your mud info, not your Unix info.  


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;       -intermud mail (based on the mud name not the address)
&gt; 
&gt; One word: SMTP

I haven't tried it from a mud from either Cold or Moo. 
Does this go from mud-to -mud or mud-to-OS?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;       -ftp/telnet
&gt; 
&gt; uhh
&gt; 
Is your comment based on the fact that it's standard for Cold, or
 why would anyone want it?  I use telnet a lot to connect to other 
muds so that I can get access to information that I don't have on 
my server.  Also some conversations is better in virtual presence 
instead of channels so its a quick popover to the other mud.

The ftp is useful considering the way that MudOS sees things. 
The root of a mud ftp is
	{yourlib-loc}/lib/ftp
This allows people to move code around without needing system access. 
Otherwise I would have to give a wizard an account on my system and 
let her ftp to my machine and so on.  Then the files have to be moved 
to the library area.

I believe the LP world is trying to go the same was as Cold-- to put 
a lot of the services in the mud itself without having to go out to 
the Unix/NT/whatever environments.
