&lt; 	This may be a basic question, BUT: in the Coldmud distribution as
&lt; currently constituted, there are C-- files for a help system that is not
&lt; loaded into the textdump file by the make-world script.  Is this help
&lt; system in condition to be loaded?  I get an error when I tried patching
&lt; the make-world script to load the help files along with everything else.

No, it is not.

I was about to say you could just come dump it from the cold dark, but I
remembered we have changed too much to be compliant with world6 core (Security
and core object structure are all different).
