&gt; A serious RPg is a big undertaking.  I can't imagien anyoien doing anything
&gt; that will live up to any of NBC's hopes for free.

True, it 's a lot of work and takes time to build up a decent mud.  But from
NBC
perspective, they are building up their web page, and the mud is an extension
of that.
I suspect that someone from the web design team pitched the idea about using a
mud;
probably there was some mild interest on the producer's part, but no budget.
So the
software engineer has to start now and show some resullts by the end of Q1 (my
guess).
