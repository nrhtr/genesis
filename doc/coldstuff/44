&gt; &gt; I'd like to cast a vote of in-server regexp routines.  
&gt; 
&gt; ...cast a vote????  This is Greg's baby, he can make the decisions, no voting
&gt; involved.  What we have to do is convince Greg :)
&gt; 
&gt; (Sorry, with NetrekII that is a peeve of mine--when non-coders decide they 
&gt; can just randomly vote on something and make you do it).

Uh, what makes you think I'm a non-coder?  Anyhow, point taken, I should
have rather said, 
  "I voice my wish that reg-exp coding was done in-server in COLD"

&gt; &gt; Could someone give me a clue on what a "client robot" is?
&gt; 
&gt; It is something on another machine which runs a character.
&gt; 
&gt; I dont understand how Greg would want all automaton's to be clients though,
&gt; what about the hundreds of creepies, merchants, npc's, etc?  Are we just 
&gt; going to reconnoiter our entire campus of computers to run the MUD? :)
&gt;

Yeah, I got that.  But as you pointed out, it just doesn't seem to make sense
to relegate automated "text-emitters" to *clients*.  There must be some
equivocation on what a "robot" is, which is why I'm asking the question.
(BTW, I've done a lot of work in AI-like NPCs and in modeling animalistic
behavior, not to mention weather and other "text-emitting", VR-enriching
type of frivolities.)
