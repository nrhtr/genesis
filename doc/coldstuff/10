I've heard complaints that connection objects are sticking around in
database.  There are several reasons why this might occur, but I can't
reproduce the situation in Cold World in any of the three cases where
connection objects get destroyed.

Since the Cold World database keeps one connection object around at
all times in order to deal with the next incoming connection, it seems
likely that the leak occurs when you shut down and start back up.  It
might be a good idea to do a
	
	for obj in ($connection.children())
	    destroy(obj);

in $sys.startup().
