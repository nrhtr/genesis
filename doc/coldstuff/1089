&gt; &gt; $help_index_driver        -- urg, what to do?  need to change driver help
&gt; &gt; $help_node_driver_...     -- ^^^^ (Miro?)
&gt; 
&gt; @edit &lt;helpnode&gt; to edit it. You can change node's index by calling
&gt; node.[add|del]_index (or something, check the methods on $help_node.

We had a discussion a little while back as to where the authoritative 
source is for the driver docs.  The reason I dont like using what we have 
in db right now is because it didnt all convert correctly.  Because I 
dont know what to treat as the source I havnt updated any of the docs 
since about patch 8.  What I think I'm going to do is take the stuff on 
the web, strip the HTML and just do my own formatting that a perl script 
can frob to HTML or CML.  comments/concerns?

&gt; &gt; $tree                     --\ Jeff Artifacts, what do to with $tree, nix?
&gt; &gt; $tree_4                   --/ still used?  $help_node_* used to use it..
&gt; 
&gt; @grep for these, I didn't like this code. :) Nothing seems to use it now.

I didnt like the idea of $tree's either, seemed redudnant.  They are nixed.

&gt; &gt; $heart/$scheduler         -- review, I would like to make $scheduler native
&gt; 
&gt; $scheduler is outdated and buggy. My suggestion is to use dictionary instead
&gt; of heap for event table.

I thought somebody rewrote $scheduler already?  As for its future, we 
should just make a $scheduler native module.

&gt; &gt; $read_parser              -- rename/move in heirarchy, its not an official
&gt; &gt;                              'parser', it parses from the connection not the
&gt; &gt;                              user's parser stack
&gt; 
&gt; I'd move this to $login_connection ?

No, I think it can be used on many connection types.. (ponder)

Other than that, I'm going to start @dump'ing some stuff for a contrib 
archive, It'll likely be non-functional but can be used for reference.
