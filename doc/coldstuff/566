On changing = to =:

a valid reason for not changing it: you have to rewrite all existing code.
trivial but annoying. 

even more trivial: its an extra character ;)


I don't see arguments about difficulty of grasping the concept of
assignment vs test of equality as particularly reasonable. That would
be like changing english "no" to something else just because japanese
"no" means something different. explain the concept of assignment,
explain the concept of test for equality, then explain the sybols for
these operations.

Not that I really care that much, I think the whole = vs =: thing is
quite nitpicky and trivial. (And people rarely care what I think ;)
