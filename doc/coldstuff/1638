&gt; I allready forwarded this one to Brandon (as did Brian,
&gt; who coded it) but I should point out there's an updated
&gt; patch for double precision floating points against Genesis
&gt; 1.1.9.
&gt; I won't spam the list with it but if you didn't get ahold
&gt; of it yet I'll forward it too you aswell.

I have the patch against p5 that you forwarded to the list on
October 29 or so.  Feel free to forward me a more recent version.

&gt; And I would like to thank Brian for the bother of reworking it ;).

And thanks to Brian for having written it in the first place.

The only other patch that I've picked up is the GD support from
Brandon for generating images on the fly.  Anything else out
there?  (I have a bunch of my own patches to integrate in yet and
still some code to get written as well, so ther is plenty of
time.)
