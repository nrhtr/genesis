We were just thinking odd thoughts the other day, and I suddenly thought it
would be nice if you could "link" an object with a data type, and then be able
to use that data type as you would a frob.  For example, say I like $list to
all 'list data types, I could do:

   vlist = [$obj, $obj, $obj];
   vlist = vlist.map('name)

which would be the same as currently typing:

   vlist = $list.map(vlist, 'name);

Anyhow, what made me think of this was something Jordan (Chaos) said a long
time ago, and just the odd thoughts of the evening.  Right now it would take
about ---&gt; &lt;--- this much core modification to adjust, as 99% of the utility
object methods already require the data type to be modified as the first
element.

On another note, is Greg waking from the dead?  Are we going to be expecting a
newer version of ColdMUD? (current is 0.10.1)...?
