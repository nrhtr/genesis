Hokay, I tried the macho route and quickly caved in to reveal the
whimpering code-craven that I truly am.  Has anybody gone this route
and figured out The Answers to installing Cold on BSDI?  

I made all of the recommended edits for BSD 4.3 and SunOS, but I get
the following results when I run the make.  Is this a flaw in the BSDI
include files, or is Cold neglecting to include a proper file for
BSDI?

(Yes, yes, I know, it's not Cold's fault, BSDI is breaking some sort
of rule and it's not posix-complaint or whatever, but that still
leaves me between a rock and a hard place).

Anxiously awaiting your insight...
                                   Puff
