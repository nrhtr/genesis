I've been thinking lately (ouch).

why don't we define up a bunch of "services" or ports that all coldmuds should
listen to, just as a standard, for various different things, such as
(brainstorming):

smtpd (same as SMTP, protocol and all)             6625
nntpd (hsm, brainstorm)                            66119
httpd                                             &lt;ack, dont know the usual
                                                   httpd port, 66 + whatever&gt;
faucet (it just spams something, like inet faucet) 6663
rcommands                                          6664
coldlink (funky idea with ...stuff :)              6665
connection                                         6666

-----------------
Anyhow, comments?  the coldlink port is an idea I have for doing expanded
server-&gt;server linking, which would include passing minor attributes of a user.

We could also figure up some other link aspects (distributed stuff?)

Aigh, Caramba!  Remember that  MOO is gearing up for multiple ports soon, now
would be a good time to share your thoughts with the likes of Pavel C.  It'd
be a shame if every M** server on the inet had a different standard set of
ports.

Ay/Net.
