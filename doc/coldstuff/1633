I'd be interested in a small piece of space if possible.  Just let me know
what I need to do, thanks.

&gt; Read the message.  It stated: A VARIANT OF.
&gt;
&gt; Specifically since this is a no-charge situation anything relating in
&gt; any way shape or form to a charge will be removed.  The parts I
&gt; personally care about deal with acceptable use (i.e. consuming
&gt; bandwidth and resources kindly).
&gt;
&gt; But thanks for pointing it out, I'll keep it in mind when I make the
&gt; actual agreement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So it will be in some part self regulating as far as load goes.  This
&gt; &gt; &gt; community server will become glacier.cold.org, and will require a
&gt; &gt; &gt; signed acceptable use policy (a variant of:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.roguetrader.com/agreement.html)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's moot, of course, but I wouldn't sign an agreement like that if my
very
&gt; &gt; life depended on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some highlights are the instantly variable charges due and payable at
the
&gt; &gt; instant of consumption variability without notice; total disclaimer for
&gt; &gt; fitness for purpose or merchantable quality;  the non-competition
clause, and
&gt; &gt; the several absolute discretions reserved by the vendor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; About the best thing you could say about the agreement is that most of
it's
&gt; &gt; probably unenforceable.
