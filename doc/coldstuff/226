&gt;      I want to have a Pow-Wow of whomever is interested.  What we will discuss
&gt; is the directions of development we will be taking with the Cold Dark--and it's
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; core--in the future.  Let us tenatively schedule it for May 18th (Wednesday) at
&gt; 5:00 pm (dont know how this works with SamIAm/Australia).

&gt; (BTW, how stable is this list?  If necessary I can throw a list up on tiny)
&gt; 

Do you mean ColdMUD? And why is a meeting of any sort in order? Any ideas that
 can be shared at a meeting can just as easily be sent to this list.

If you really do mean tCD, why post to this list about it? Or do you think the
 tCD core is the only decent core, since we all know world 6 bites?
