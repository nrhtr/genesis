&gt; The only pro for using vt codes is that it is a KNOWN standard. Far as I know
&gt; there really is not a very wide spread standard for anything else...

not all ASCII unprintable bit sequences are vt codes.  moving beyond raw
text&amp;telnet to smart client/server interaction makes efficient protocols
desirable.  (where you don't have to ignore &gt;25% of potential data received
just because of archaic security holes in ancient terminal protocols.)
for my graphical client, any line beginning with a non-printable character
is assumed to be something more interesting and is parsed as such.
hardcoding servers to limit me from using this seems short-sighted, especially
considering the goal of the project is to increase the potential power of
designers.
