&gt; Is there a way to impliment colour in the above mentioned commands? 
&gt; For example if a user wanted to have red text in one word and green in
&gt; another word in a pose can it be done?

In $body.emote_cmd, say_cmd, etc., you can run the string(s) through
$compiler.compile_cml, and use the returned ctext frob instead of the
string(s).

This would mean that whatever someone types along with a `say' command, for
example, gets parsed as CML, and braces need to be escaped if they don't
want them to be parsed this way.

If you do this, it's probably a good idea to make the parsing an optional
feature, somehow, like by having a :parse-cml=[boolean] setting on bodies.
