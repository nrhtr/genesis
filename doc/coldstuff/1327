&gt; I'm looking for a way to separate people based on how
&gt; they log in so that certain people will go to certain realms.
&gt; This means that I don't want everyone to login and be at the pit.
&gt; I had considered having different ports for different users or
&gt; a menu where a person can select a realm.  Any suggestions?

    $world.starting_place()

Right now it simply returns a setting (@set $world:) but you can have it
return whatever..

&gt; Actually this is two problems.  First is the "login to different realms" 
&gt; and the second is handling sleeping bodies.  If people change their
&gt; home, then they show as sleeping bodies when they disconnect.  I would
&gt; rather than the housekeeper grab then and then on login they are
&gt; restored.  Or --the mush style-- is to have them dark. 

Look at the housekeeper code--rather than taking them home (or ignoring
them if they are already home) you can do whatever.
