I was parousing your web instructions on how to install cold and it says the following.

make - to make what ever
make install - to make it and install

Although I am new to FreeBSD I have managed to at least twice do sucessful make and make installs of previous versions of Cold.  But there always seemed to be something missing that I had to go hunting down.  Part of it is the dns thingy it tries to cp then chmod at the end of make install.  It doesn't exist.

Don't ask me how I managed to get it going in the first place.  But I suspect that I d/l the database and some how it did the work when I untarred it and such.  Then I copied missing stuff to the appropriate directories.

If you have any clue as to what I'm doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.  Like I said, I do have two sucessful installs of Cold going that I did myself.

Anyways, hope to hear from ya'll and maybe I can figure out what it is I'm doing wrong here.  But for now I've just got Genesis-1.1.8-STABLE.tar.gz.

Thanks,

Kris Anderson
