&gt; I would be interested to know (since the copyright

&gt; and adding alot more to the ColdCore engine. The
&gt; commercial use would be in the form of a subscription
&gt; to my MUD, that is I am not selling Cold at all...


The license certainly allows for this in both the case of ColdCore and for
Genesis.  There is already commercial usage in this fashion.  The Eternal
City at http://www.bignetwork.com/hc/ec/ is the major example of this today.

&gt; With that out of the way I will have a whole slew
&gt; of questions, which I will move most of over to
&gt; the ColdCore list.


Great!
