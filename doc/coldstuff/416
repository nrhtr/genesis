&lt;   TheColdDark was a core developed by Brandon Gilespie_(sp?)_ and others

Gillespie

&lt;   including Robert de Forest for a while. It was much better fleshed out
&lt;   than world-0.6, but was very messy, owing to a lack of dirrection and
&lt;   agreement on the part of the developers.

&lt;   tCD is available, and in the state described in a previous post by
&lt;   Brandon himself.

&lt;   tCD seems to be dead, as Brandon has pressed on to other things and
&lt;   everyone else has either gone back to MOO or is working on the new
&lt;   FrozenApples.

The Cold Dark is still thrashing around.  In a few weeks it will be back online
and it will be cleaned up a bit.  As Crag stated before, it is somewhat messy,
however all this is in personal projects--most of which I think will be axed
(unless somebody speaks up quickly).  The actual core is quite near a finished
state--and is much more functional than the default world 0.6.  I'm not dead
yet!
