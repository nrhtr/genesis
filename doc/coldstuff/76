Hi all,

	You may remember a question or two I posted a couple of weeks
ago.  In a nutshell, a friend of mine, Scott, wants to start up a BBS
running some sort of MUD.  I'm talking him into using ColdMUD, because
I think it's nifty.  I could really use some advice on the platform.

	Question is, what's the best platform to set it up on, taking
into account feasibility and cost?  And what's the best way to
establish connectivity?

	Scott just went out and purchased a Packard Bell 486 DX 66Mhz
with 8meg of ram and a 400-odd meg hard drive, but he can still return
it if it's horribly wrong (Best Buy 30-day "no questions asked" return
policy).

	I'm assuming that running Linux or some other brand of free
UNIX for x86 machines is best.  How do FreeBSD and such measure up
against Linux?

	What kind of a load (disk space, RAM, CPU) would ColdMUD
impose on a regular UNIX system (i.e. what if he rents space on one of
Netcom's systems, or Colorado SuperNet?)?

	We're based in Denver, Colorado.  Scott wants to eventually
set up a multi-line BBS for players, but right now he's looking for
the most cost-effective method to run the system in a "development"
mode; probably SLIPping into Netcom or something similar, to allow the
developers to connect and work on stuff.  He's not independently
wealthy, but he's committed to doing this; any suggestions for the
most cost-effective method?
