I've released Coldmud 0.8.1 to ftp.ccs.neu.ed, in
pub/mud/drivers/coldmud, as coldmud-0.8.1.tar.gz.  The documentation
has not changed.

The frob-reading bug is fixed, along with several problems with
administrative functions leaking stack frames and thus not working
inside loops.  Please tell me about any problems you have with this
release.

Currently scheduled for 0.9:

	* Hostname passed to 'connect' method
	* Possibly some modification to how connect() works to allow
	  for task recognition.  (I have to add task IDs at some point
	  anyway, may as well do it before 1.0.)
	* match_regexp()

Although I'm not terribly satisfied with regexps for pattern-matching
(as Quinn pointed out, it's missing certain things like "any left
subsequence of a seequence of characters", so matching abbreviations
is hard), regexps are popular and well-known, so I think I will go
with them rather than complicate the match_pattern() template syntax
more.
