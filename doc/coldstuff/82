Ok, here is the output:

pid 9159 (coldmud) was killed on an unaligned access, at pc 0x40128c

doesnt really help much, I can drag it into gdb and re-do the error if you
want.

Basically, what I was doing is trying to chparent something, unfortunately with
the new way .init works in the 4.0 world you cannot initialize an object upon
creation, anyhow in dealing with this problem I was playing around, I created
$storymaster (it wasnt initialized) and I did: 
;$builder.add_parent($storymaster) (was currently $person ($storymaster also
was $person)), I was then going to $builder.del_parent($person), but it crashed
the server...Just thought youd like to know :)
