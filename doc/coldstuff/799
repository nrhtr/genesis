&gt; Native methods are simply functions bound on an object in the same means

&gt; I'm considering two implementations:

&gt;   #1: Add them to the methods list, hooking into the native code rather than
&gt;       the pcode.  The disadvantage of this lies in it can be awkward.

Awkward?  How?

&gt;   #2: adding a new operator which is a native method operator, for now let
&gt;       us pretend this is '&amp;', so to call a native method you would execute
&gt;       (from the object which has them hashed) it with:
&gt; 
&gt;           &amp;function(..).
&gt; 
&gt;       This would give you more configurability, in that you could more
&gt;       easilly create wrappers.  For instance, consider the string functions,
&gt;       if you wanted to add 'fill', you would:

Why would this be more configurable?  You could achieve the same thing by 
binding a private method to the native code and wrapping that.  In 
addition, you wouldn't need to add a whole other hashtable, and it would 
be much more transparent to move the implementation of a method back and 
forth between native and p-code.
