Robert Lumley and I were talking, recently, about the snifty new addition
of automatic conversion to string via the '+' operator.  we were thinking
that there is a potential danger in hiding the means of conversion from the
programmer, so we were wondering about the possibility of operator
overloading...  the same task could be accomplished without hiding the
means of operation, and it could also be broadly applied other ways.  I'd
also rather like it if new operators could be defined.  it could make for
some very nice looking, clean code.

one problem I see is that this could make for some really strange oddments
that would be made up to look like something else, even though they parsed
out in coldc via overloaded operators.

anyhow, comments?
