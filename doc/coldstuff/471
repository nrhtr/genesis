&gt; 
&gt; &lt; I'll hapily dnate some space on serial for the archive site.
&gt; &lt; I've started by making pub/coldmud and stuffing everything that looked
&gt; &lt; coldmudish in incoming into there - anyone want to volunteer to maintain it?
&gt; &lt; Crag?  I'll also see what I can do about setting up a web server there in order
&gt; &lt; to support some Coldmud web pages, if anyone is interested in writing such 
&gt; &lt; things.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, serial is ungodly slow (Sorry zachary, but it is, took me nearly 10
&gt; minutes to download something from it one time).  If there is dire need for an
&gt; archive I have an Alpha machine with ~1 gig of space available, which is also
&gt; sitting directly on the router to the T1-&gt;T3 (i.e. kickin net connection).

Hrm. serial's slowness is prolly due to it being a 486/33, not its net
connection - it's just a machine or two away from the router to the T1...

&gt; But, since Jay volunteered why not let it be at neu (since there already is a
&gt; nice MUD archive there...).

That's probably a good idea... go Jay!
