Greetings,

I'm sending a small coding issue here at Bruce's suggestion.

My problem is the following: I'm coding a turbolift. To operate properly,
it should do the following when someone tries to enter it (aka tries to be
move_to'ed to it).
1) Check wether the lift is at the same deck the player is, 2a) If this is
the case, return and let the move_to occur or 2b) If this is not the case,
activate lift code to make it move to the player's position (he or she
summoned it) and then abort the move.

Now initially I tried to solve this aborting in the same way that worked
for my turbolift version on LambdaMOO. Namely to hack into
$place.will_arrrive(), do the necessary checks and if I would need to
abort, I would cancel the task.

However Bruce advised me not to do this and throw an error, and indeed I
found this to be the most logical solution. (as cancelling the task would
take a lot more workarounds)
But now the question remains where to catch it then...

I'm only a beginner in ColdC, so I deem the solution simple enough :)
Yet I would prefer not to code a $path solely for use for this turbolift.
(as to catch from $path.invoke).

Thanks in advance,
Sim.
