&gt; I've looked at both E and Java as alternatives to ColdX and rejected them
&gt; both for the following reasons:

I agree that I've been slow in considering Java, but the problem is 
the virtual worlds needs something that can generate critical mass. 
Java
right now has the critical mass.  This means that I actually can go out
and hire Java programmers.  And of course there is funding for projects
that have "Java" as the buzzword. 

&gt; In re implementing ColdX in JAVA (or E), the efficiency issues would scare
&gt; me. You are putting an interpreter on top of another interpreter. JAVA has
&gt; become a pretty fast interpreter but it still is NOT even in the same order
&gt; of magnitude i think as good C or C++ code..

Java has to get faster, that's all there is to it.  A lot of companies
are
concerned about the speed. 

I think the evolution of Java will be towards better performance so that
you
can write reasonably fast servers with stronger security and distributed
computing.
I don't know what the scripting language will look like or how you
handle the
dynamic mechanisms.  Python does it better, but it's a speciality
language without
the critical mass.

Yes, this is still a Cold-related topic.  It's for version 2.x, 3.x,
whatever...
