Besides tCD, there is also World6, which should be available at the
same place you got ColdMUD. Its nothing but the bare minimum of a
core, but it does allow you to start from somewhere.

As Brandon said, the Version of tCD he made available isnt a real
core, its the last textdump of tCD, with a lot of extra stuff. I'm
trying to clean some of that up, but don't have too much time myself.

Who else is still playing with tCD?  Oh, and are you still running
colddarkthings, Brandon? (since thats where any discussions of tCD
should be)
