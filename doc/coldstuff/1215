&gt;  Something ocurred to me the other night.....
&gt; 
&gt; What prevents Genesis from re-entering an object with a Paused or
&gt; Suspended method on another thread?  Seems pretty dangerous unless there
&gt; is a JAVA like "monitor" than can be sued for synchronization.

It's also completely prevented by the fact that Cold doesn't support
threads yet. :) Yes, there will be locking, once we need it.

&gt; 
&gt; The Interperter currently does a C function call through a dispatch
&gt; table for EVERY opcode.  I suspect by judicious in-lining with a
&gt; switch() statement in teh execute() function of the most common
&gt; operators (things like +, -,++,--) we could SIGNIFICANTLY improve
&gt; performance.....   a C-call per fundemental math op is really kinda sick
&gt; and totally unecessary, IMO.
&gt; 

Actually, there wouldn't be any improvement. Operators, even the 'trivial'
ones, spend far more time than a single C call on typechecking their
arguments.

Although, admittedly, profiler I used still reports that Cold spends
unpleasant ammount of time in the main intepreter loop. I don't really
think this can be easily fixed, and as for the /hard/ way to fix it...
Well, we're working on it. :)
