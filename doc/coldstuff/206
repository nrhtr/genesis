&gt; &lt; As a corellary to point 2 should the core methods that add a parameter
&gt; &lt; also add the set and retrieve methods for the parameter (pehaps based on
&gt; &lt; a template?) This would of course be modifiable, but would then be 
&gt; &lt; useful in preventing typing in the accessor each time. alternately
&gt; &lt; a template accessor could be called or inherited, although im unclear
&gt; &lt; on how to inherit a uniqely named method. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would definitely say no.  This is because doing such a thing would lead to
&gt; bad coding immediately, where people yearning for MOO would just fall back in
&gt; to MOO patterns.  Often times you do not even WANT to have direct
&gt; accessor methods for values, an example would be $input and
&gt; $input_parser at tCD.  $input has two parameters ,receiving and
&gt; ,input.  ,input is only added to by .new_line() 

You don't always want a setter method, but you do pretty often (at
least I do), and it's a pain to write one each time.  On JH, I wrote a
verb "@make-setter &lt;object&gt;.&lt;property&gt;" which installs the standard
thing.  It might make sense to do this, and also provide commands that
automatically make add/delete methods, or push/pop methods, or
whatever you commonly use.

It might also make sense to make whatever your equivalent of @property
is take an extra argument (or more than one) that specifies whether
you want to have setter/adder/deleter/whatever methods added at the
same time.
