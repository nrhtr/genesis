If I'd heard anything from Colin, I wouldn't say so, and I wouldn't tell you he
 had dropped by and sent me mail and asked that I not say anything. So don't
 ask. He may be on the net, he may not.

Wherever he is, I can tell yuo he is still madly coding away at ColdMUD. There
 will be another release and it will be written in C++.

Three cheers for MOO polotics. NOT.

Wine's pleasure,
Love's intoxication,
Work's obsession,
Children's involvement,
Age's sorrow,
When will craving end?
