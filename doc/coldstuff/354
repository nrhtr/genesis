I have not doen the research on this, and Greg can correct me if I'm wrong
 but isn't this simply a matter of when IO is handled in the server?

Main order of things hapenening:
Wait for IO or heartbeat
  if IO happens, turn it into a method call
  exectue the method
    any 'echo()' statements put stuff in the apropriate outbound buffer
    text_dump() calls just 'happen' right away
  when the method returns or a traceback uses up the stack...
  send out the stuff in the net buffers
loop all over again
  (Same deal with a heartbeat event)

As I said, I did not just now go look at the code, but if I were writing the
 server, I would do it this way. It is not a great mystery to me, and it
 doesn't bother me. Just use your scheduler to make the announcement go out
 one tick before the text_dump() call.

Crag,
wondering why this is still a question when everyone has a copy of the code.

P.S. Sorry I haven't changed my .sig yet...
