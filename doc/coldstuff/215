&lt;&gt;&gt; * The user generally doesn't want any processing to get in the way
&lt;&gt;&gt; when it's not necessary; therefore, no processing at all is done on
&lt;&gt;&gt; the last argument.
&lt;
&lt;&gt; This is bad.  It is bad quite simply because it means parsing is
&lt;&gt; handled differently in some cases than in others and it's not always
&lt;&gt; immediately obvious which is which.  Rules should be consistent for
&lt;&gt; the entire match or not exist at all.
&lt;
&lt; I disagree.  For user-level parsing, the primary job of the parser is
&lt; to keep its nose out of the user's business (for examples of parsers
&lt; which forget this rule, see Mush).  Consistency is secondary; the user
&lt; spends a lot of time in the parser and will learn its rules quickly
&lt; enough.

I think Consistency is not secondary, when a user finds that rules apply only
in some circumstances and not others, they instantly begin to think it is
worlds more complex than it is.  By getting a base level of consistancy it is
much easier to comprehend to a beginning user, especially the non-computer
literate type.

&lt;&gt; No, MOO parsing does not function this way (iobjstr quoting is
&lt;&gt; handled exactly the same as dobjstr quoting, the way it should be),
&lt;&gt; nor does anything else that I am familiar with.
&lt;
&lt; You are correct; it is Coolmud's verb-dobj-prep-iobj parsing which
&lt; works the same way as Coldmud's "verb * prep *" template matching.
&lt;
&lt; Here are some examples of user commands which show why I prefer the
&lt; "quote the whole argument or none of it" rule.
&lt;
&lt;	@desc here as A sign on the road says, "Burma Shave."
&lt;	whisper The spy told me, "Ken sent me." to dave
&lt;
&lt; MOO mangles both of these.

This is true, I had not considered it.  How about using some less common
character for specifying what should only be used as a wild match?  This would
be somewhat against norms, but it would be easier.  Perhaps a `text` which is
rarely ever used in writing, I would say ' but its nearly as common as " ...
(i.e.):

     "f * dd * z"    "f `dd f` dd f z"   =&gt; ["f", "dd f", "dd", "f", "z"]

Just a thought.
