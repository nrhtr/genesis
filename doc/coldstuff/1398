In another fit of boredom I just hacked in quite a few improvements to the
moo2coldc perl script which converts a MOO object @dump.  Its pretty smart
now--but still does not get everything.  Go ahead and take it around the
block.  @dump a MOO object to a file, run this on the .moo file and it'll
do two things: print conversion messages to stdout, and write to a .cdc
file.  Edit the .cdc file--do or pay attention to anything the conversion
messages mentioned, and also search through the file for any 'CONVERSION
NOTE' comment and follow its warnings/instructions as appropriate.

Just for reference, I took a mild MOO object (about 10 verbs) converted it
and without any diddling pasted the .cdc file direct into a coldCore and
it compiled without complaint.  Note: just because it compiles does not
mean it'll run--there will still be a bit of work involved.

You can get the new and improved script from:

       ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/contrib/scripts/moo2coldc.gz

It requires perl5.
