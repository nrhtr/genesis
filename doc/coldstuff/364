&lt;&gt;  conn_assign()           =&gt; assign_connection()
&lt; Can this be reassign_connection?

That sounds good.

&lt;&gt;  filename 'textdump'     =&gt; 'text_dump' (to fit with text_dump())
&lt; Can we change text_dump() to textdump() instead?

Well, I thought of that, but most function names have underscores for spaces,
AND 'binarydump()' (which would also be changed for consistancy) doesn't feel
very good...

We could call it 'coldmud.dump' or something (or whatever arg 0 is + .dump).

&lt; Sounds good. I didn't realize you had taken over development of the ColdMUD
&lt; 'driver'.

Never said I was taking over the development of ColdMUD, I just feel these
changes are very needed, and since they are trivial to make I am.  If people
wish to use the Cold Dark core I can give them a patch, actually I will
probably just have a CDC version of the latest source (whatever that is), which
is compatable in this format.

&lt; Perhaps you and Colin should take new names for your versions, so
&lt; as to avoid confusion. 

I thought Colin was net.dead

&lt; What else are you changing if anything?

Oh, I took out dictionaries, and symbols, and hardcoded the parser in the
driver.
