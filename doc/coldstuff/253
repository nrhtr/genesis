Side note: the maximum value of a port is 2^16 - 1, or 65,535.
Although Coldmud may allow you to bind to a port above that, you're
actually binding to (unsigned)(n) % 65,536.

&gt;&gt; There is a primitive which makes use of connection information,
&gt;&gt; echo() or somesuch... are you suggesting that this is not needed,
&gt;&gt; or rather that the appropriate place for accessing current connection
&gt;&gt; is the server, and only there?

&gt; Actually, the current functioning of echo(), in my opinion, is
&gt; something to be changed, rather than emulated.  In my opinion,
&gt; echo() should only work when this() is an object with a current
&gt; connection bound to it, and should echo to all connections bound to
&gt; the current object, thus preserving encapsulation and a consistent
&gt; connection&lt;-&gt;object interface.

This is how echo() operates, actually.

Coldmud's design was based very much upon that of existing mud
servers; if I write another server, it will depart from this model in
a number of ways.
