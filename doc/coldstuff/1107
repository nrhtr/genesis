&gt;&gt; Well, I decided to mess around a bit with the latest driver, so I
&gt;&gt; compiled it up on my linux box (no problems at all.. very cool) and
&gt;&gt; pulled a brand new Minimalcore out of the box and ran it.
&gt;
&gt;I'm hoping to have another ALPHA4 core available today--with @build and
&gt;company fixed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Except:
&gt;&gt; It has one command, QUIT. Said command doesn't seem to work.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Really. I mean it. I type QUITE and it responds with Goodbye.
&gt;&gt; but I stay connected.  Anyone care to explain this?  I read the code
&gt;&gt; and it all seems to look okay.  I don't grok.
&gt;
&gt;Erm, it should have said:
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; QUIT
&gt;  Oops, `QUIT` is not supported here.  Try `@quit`
&gt;  Use `@help commands` for an explanation on the differences in commands.
&gt;
&gt;There is an object in your command cache that knows a few of the
&gt;unsupported commands, and points you in the right direction (I opted to do
&gt;this rather than dirty up the actual command environment with lots of
&gt;different awkward non-standard (by my standards :) aliases)  Use the
&gt;command '@which QUIT' to see all of the places it shows up (@which does
&gt;not check command aliases, as they are from a different parser).

Uh, this is MINIMALCORE-3.2.  You're talking about ColdCore.  

&gt;Typing QUITE does:
&gt;
&gt;  I don't understand QUITE.

erp. that was a typo on my part. I really typed QUIT.

Under MinimalCore-3.2.  Really. Not Coldcore. or CDC or anything like that.
MinimalCore.   Someone else already acknowledged that it was broken in 
private email and said he'd u/l'd a fix to /Incoming  already.
