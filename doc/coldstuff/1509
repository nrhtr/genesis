&gt;     I think the majority of the geek world recognize that the
&gt;majority of the "advancements" beyond text are just bloat and feature
&gt;creep.  Now if you wanted to maintain the docs in FrameMaker format

This is a pointless religous debate I fear. My simple answer is go look at sales 
figures.  But its not worth much more debate.

Getting back to brandon's problewm. Brandon- -are you on Linux or Solaris? if so 
you should try downloading StarOffice fron sun.com.

Its free and wil lsolve your immediate problem with being unable to use Word 
documents.


&lt;religous flame bait on, Im afraid&gt;
P.S.  Framemaker is the stadnard here where I work, Sun, for layout. Most of the 
technical writers I've asked though say that while it's layout is superb, its 
text processing is inadaquate.  Most of them compsoe test in Vi or Emacs and 
import...
&lt;/religous flame bait&gt;

Thought to meditate on:

No two objects in nature are equal, any two apples are in fact quite different 
from any other two apples in the world.

Thus can Math really be said to be True in an absolute concrete sense, 
or is it merely an internally consistent abstraction?
