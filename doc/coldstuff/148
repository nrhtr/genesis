Greg is ressurected for a slight moment and says:
&gt; I have to apologize for disappearing suddenly, but my life has become
&gt; very hectic very quickly.

woo, he finally speaks..

&gt; I'm still very interested in coldmud, and plan to get back to it when
&gt; I have time.  I plan to rewrite the server as a multithreaded C++
&gt; program and introduce some other innovations; I think I may also be
&gt; able to solve some of the needling core design issues, but this will
&gt; all be later.

the C++ bit sounds cool.  As for the other stuff, preety much everything has
ground to a halt because of the server crashing error.  Nobody can do anything
until its fixed.  You can live with some errors--like the dbref bug, and
even the disappearing parameters, but NOT the segfault upon startup.  I think
Zachary is having a friend run the server through purify, as it seems like its
a memory problem somewhere along the line.
