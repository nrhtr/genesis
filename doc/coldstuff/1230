<HR><H2>[COLD] Genesis 1.0 Patch 23</H2>

This patch includes:

    * several minor bug fixes in join, split and a few file functions.
    * the cancel() bug fix.
    * Standardized arg ... [more]; format to follow scatter assignments,
      will accept both formats but decompile as @more now.
    * Compilable Win32 Support (Thanks Jon!)

Read the README file for Win32 support.  To keep the source tree's the
same you still need access to a unix box, which will generate the files
for the Win32 platform.  Please, feel free to test this and let me know
how it goes.  So far it has just been compiled in Borland C.  Also give me
a log of what you had to do on the Win32 side (as far as setting up
projects or getting a makefile).  Basically, the source will compile in
a Win32 platform--however, how you compile it is still up to you :)

Enjoy;
