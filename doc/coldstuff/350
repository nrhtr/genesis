I recently heard of the change coming to MOO suspend some time in the next
 release or two. It will allow an indefinite suspend, and a resume() will
 restart the task. I was also speaking with someone writting another
 language and discussed 'continuations' a kind of frozen task.

It occurred to me that these ideas, if applied to cold well, could make
 in-db task management better than anything I've used. If a method can copy
 the current task, you automatically have the ability to fork. If you can
 tell a task queue object to run this copy later and then kill the current
 task you have suspend().

Here's the really cool part: If all of this revolves around a task object
 class, you could have traceback info available, you could do funky debugging,
 etc.

I'm sending these thoughts to this list for a number of reasons. First, to
 record them as considered. Second to suggest them to subscribed server
 hackers. Third, so I will get a copy and can archive it, and if I end up
 doing my own server hacking I'll have it arround to remind me.

Anybody have any thoughts about this?

P. S. Yes, I know almost none of it's my idea. I just want it.
