Ok, if we arent going to have clear props, perhaps we could add in a code
function (or whatever its called) which is used the same way
disallow_overrides; is (ie declared at the beginning), such as: 
use_parent_params; or something.  if this was declared it when it goes to
access a param, like:

foo = param;
or param = foo;
or whatever (where param is on that object), the server (with that flag) would:

param == 0 ? return obj.parent.param | return param;

yes you can code that yourself, but that is a royal pain to code everywhere,
and it is almost completely unneeded, as I know for many things you would end
up coding that TONS of times...

any comments?

oh, and without the use_parent_params; flag it would act as it does...
