Something with coldmud that I've been meaning to speak about, but always
forget, is networking.  Two things:

bind() does not seem to work with more than 1 port.  I was under the impression
  that it was supposed to, is it?  If so then there is a bug/problem
  somewhere...

IP Addresses (as strings of all things).  Right now that is the only way you
  can receiving or send a network address.  I would personally like to see it
  giving and handling names rather than the IP.  I dont know what is involved
  unfortunately.

Oh, on the stridx function, Richelieu reminded me about the "in" ability (duh),
so the only usage of stridx would be for reverse indexing, which is very
helpful for wrapping a string (which would still be nice).  The question now
would be for such a builtin would we want to support normal indexing as well,
to be uniform, or just make a reverse index? (and Riche requested a name other
than that relating to a zit cream :)  Would we just want 'rindex?'  or
'strindex' to handle forward/backwards indexing?

Oh, and I still wanna "clear_parameter($defining_obj, $inherited_obj, 'param)"
