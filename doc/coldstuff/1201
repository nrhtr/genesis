&gt; I've been looking at the $motd code, trying to find a
&gt; simple way to customize it.
&gt; 
&gt; One way would be to take $motd.build, and instead
&gt; of passing $motd.build('default) as the logon screen,
&gt; construct a custom message. My first thought was
&gt; to do:
&gt; 
&gt; $motd.build('title, 'driver, "", "A brief explanation 1", "more 
&gt;    explanation2, "");
&gt; 
&gt; However, this didn't work as all strings are translated to
&gt; "" when used as output. This means that either we need to
&gt; change the code to allow non-null strings, or program 
&gt; in additional cases (such as 'disclaimer, and 'introduction)
&gt; to add to the case statement.

Actually, this looks like a bug that crept into the code over time, it
should include the literal strings.  Line 11 of $motd.build() should read:

        output += [args[1], ""];

&gt; One addition that might be helpful would be the presence
&gt; of a default_motd property. That is, when 'default is passed
&gt; as the argument to $motd.build, it takes the list from default_motd
&gt; as the args. That way, it's easier to customize to the needs of
&gt; a particular world.

This is a good idea.  Also, I started but never finished--I want the
configurable parts of $motd setable through @set..
