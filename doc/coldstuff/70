&gt; Could you possibly include the original string matched against the
&gt; regexp pattern as the final element of the return value?  Sometimes
&gt; one would want to simply pass the match result and extract fields
&gt; from its indices, instead of passing both the result and the string
&gt; originally matched against it.

I have a hard time believing that you can't do

	[@match_regexp(r, s), s];

The whole idea of having a language is so that the built-in primitives
don't have to do everything for you in exactly the way that you want.

&gt; Maybe a companion substitute() as in MOO?

I'll look at it, and think about it.
