Jeff,

See JacORB at:

     http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/%7Ebrose/jacorb/

Also, I recall that Java 1.2 (due in beta real soon now) will include a
free ORB, though it won't have a lot of functionality. 

Unless you're working with a mixture of Java and non-Java code, you may 
find that RMI (included in JDK 1.1) meets all your needs and adds the 
ability to execute downloaded code as well. CORBA lacks this potentially 
useful capability, though there's talk of adding it to the standard.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've started playing with Kelvin again.  This version is beig coded in JAVA
&gt; for a variety of reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; An issue I've come across -- I've been reading up on CORBA and it looks
&gt; like a very intresting thing to base this on.  Th one problem is that JAVA
&gt; CORBA ORBs and coding kits all seem VERY expensve (int the 1 to 3 grand
&gt; range.)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't suppsoe anyone knows of a cheap but decent JAVA CORBA implementation?
&gt; 
&gt; Just checking.
