Something strange apparently happened to this message between CRL and the rest
of the world.. I haven't seen it show up on the coldstuff list and Brandon says
he didn't get his copy either, so I'm trying again.

&gt; As my mother says, "You catch more bees with honey than vinegar."

You catch FLIES with honey.  bees make their own honey anyway.

&gt; He isn't on this list because he wasn't added when he asked to be. The alleved
&gt;  new version is at homer.ncm.com, but not released because it's not done. If
&gt;  he released it unfinished y'all 'd write nasty bug reports and he'd have to
&gt;  say you asked for it. We're all getting tired of waiting, but we also have
&gt;  lives that should keep us busy while we wait.

If he released it unfinished and said "this is unfinished and I'm still working
on it" at least we'd have something to work with.  There's this thing called
beta testing..

And for your information, part of the reason I sent this message now is because
in the near future, ColdMUD will become part of my other "life" that keeps me
busy, as I'm going to be expected to work with it as part of the DU work I'm
actually going to get paid for.

&gt; I wonder if this letter's tone is one of the reasons Greg bowed out? Just a
&gt;  thought.

This letter's tone is only because I've been waiting around for at least a
month now because you said stuff was being worked on and based on results so
far that tone seems to be the only way to get much of any information out from
behind your iron curtain.  In short, you get what you ask for.

&gt; Since when has a programmer ever met a deadline? Why would you ask for a date?
&gt;  No one is getting paid for any of this (yet) and if they are they should be
&gt;  nicer still.

I'm not demanding finished wonder-servers, all I want is something to work
with, or at the very least some idea of what Jordan is even working on and how
far along he is.  So far all I've gotten from you is a lot of secrecy and "more
information later".

&gt; I wonder why my mom thought I wanted to catch bees?

I hear they're pretty good at cooperation.  Perhaps she thought you could learn
something from them.
