&gt; What is a good way of moving a user from an old db to a newer db?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to upgrade from a7 to a9.02, but I' m having some problems
&gt; with moving the user accounts.  I can transfer the $user_*s to the new
&gt; database, but if I try to connect as one of my test users, I get an
&gt; error message that the the user either doesn't exist or the password is
&gt; wrong.  If i try to create another user with the same name, i get the
&gt; message that the name is in use.
&gt; 
&gt; I also created a new test user and logged in and could see all the users
&gt; with @child $user, so I know that the users have been moved.
&gt; 
&gt; I also tried to @dump a user from one db and use tinyfugue to create the
&gt; user at a new db.  I still had the same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially I have a a9.02 database with my old rooms, exits, objects,
&gt; and people.  But the users can't log in although the password is still
&gt; the same.

Did you use the upgrade script?

The problem you are having is that all users are indexed by their name on
$user_db, so you need to insert each of them into the database.  You can
use 'coldcc' to do this:

---------------------------
% coldcc -p -tstdin
[..coldcc msgs]

eval {
    var u;

    for u in ($user.children())
        $user_db.insert(u.name(), u);
};
CTRL-D
---------------------------

Then things should be ok (I think :)
