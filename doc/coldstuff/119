&gt;I'm looking to create a core that is more accessable to the TinyMUD
&gt; family people out there, because that's one way to attract them.

What does that mean `accessable to the TinyMUD family'?  Isn't that
 taking a step backwards?  After MOO, tinymuds seem so awkward and
 primitive to me.

It is nice that we have several cores being developed.  Maybe one
 of MOO's drawbacks is that there is only one real core-db being
 used (besides maybe an OpalCore someday).
