&gt; I seem to have forgotten how to use the html stuff in Cold.
&gt; For example, I thought that the start.html went in the root
&gt; directory where the database is.  But I get "not found" error
&gt; messages when I try to access that file with a browser.
&gt; 
&gt; I also don't know what I'm suppose to put in the .../login/
&gt; file; is that an index.html?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't need detailed answers, but just a pointer or two
&gt; of what I'm suppose to be looking.

Anything that shows up on the web in '/' is actually in the root file
directory (defauling to 'root') plus html.  For instance, if you didn't
change any of the defaults it'd be in: root/html/

&gt; I also wonder if there is a editor for editing the 
&gt; complex html descriptions that are embedded in the Cold
&gt; database or is the idea to @dump the object and then use
&gt; a regular text editor.  An example of this is motd.  There
&gt; is a lot of html stuff and not an obvious way of how I can
&gt; edit it.

Most of it should be dynamically generated through CML.  For the specific
MOTD instance I can say just edit $motd.build_html--its all one line
because of an insane bout of optimization I had once. 

For other instances just ask me..
