What is a good way of moving a user from an old db to a newer db?

I'm trying to upgrade from a7 to a9.02, but I' m having some problems
with moving the user accounts.  I can transfer the $user_*s to the new
database, but if I try to connect as one of my test users, I get an
error message that the the user either doesn't exist or the password is
wrong.  If i try to create another user with the same name, i get the
message that the name is in use.

I also created a new test user and logged in and could see all the users
with @child $user, so I know that the users have been moved.

I also tried to @dump a user from one db and use tinyfugue to create the
user at a new db.  I still had the same problem.

Essentially I have a a9.02 database with my old rooms, exits, objects,
and people.  But the users can't log in although the password is still
the same.
