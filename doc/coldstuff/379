Somehow my user object at the cold dark has become corrupted again.  This time
I am baffled.  My description of what happens is vague because I dont KNOW what
is happening, I have just been able to trace it down to a general area.  I
think it is somehow corrupting buffers or something:

   If I '@show me' I get the error:

! =&gt; ~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line 14$root is not a list.
!    Thrown by interpreter opcode SPLICE_ADD.
!    ~type: ~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line
 14$brandon.method_info (~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line 14$root)
 line: 27
!    ~methoderr: ~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line 14$brandon.show
 (~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line 14$root) line: 14
!    ~methoderr: ~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line
 14$brandon.show_cmd (~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line
 14$programmer) line: 7
!    ~methoderr: ~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line
 14$brandon.parse_line (~methoderr in #37.show (defined on #1), line 14$user)
 line: 9

(as you can see something isn't right, as the above does not look like a normal
traceback).  From then on many lines are prefixed by a string, which changes
from time to time (trying to figure out what it is that causes it to change). I
hacked a .show which simply stepped through the dictionary returned by
data(object) bringing a .unparsed() version of it.  It worked great and a
cursory glance showed no immediately horrid parameters, so I expanded it to:

 for m in (data) {
   for p in (m) {
     if (type(p) == 'dictionary) {
     for line in (p) {
       actor.tell("    " + $string.unparse(line));
     }
     } else {
       actor.tell($string.unparse(p));
     }
   }
 }

the server died with a segmentation fault.

(sigh).
