Well, against Greg's advice I have been toying with run_script() (a while ago
he said it did not work, although it has been working so far...).

I was wondering if any thought has been put towards returning standard out and
probably standard err as well...?  I would like to run some scripts which
return output, but, well i'd like to RECEIVE the output.

Just off the top of my head, one of the usages is a screaming random name
generator I have (different data files, I currently have one which is
lovecraftian and i'm working on a gaelic one).

Anyhow
