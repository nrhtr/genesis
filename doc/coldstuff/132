I've thought about things a bit, and I've decided that I'm not going
to release a 1.0 too soon.

The next release will be 0.10.  I'll make it as soon as I have my
current modifications stable and some conversion scripts written.

There are several reasons for my decision: I don't think I want
coldmud to take over the world in its current state, I want more time
to do experimentation with core database designs and alternative
applications, and there are a couple of things I want to revamp.  (For
instance, because dbrefs are now numeric, there is more reason for me
to want to make the debugging output easily modified by C-- code, so
that it can display tracebacks with object names instead of with
numbers.)  I'd also like to release a 1.0-like core with the 1.0
server, and Cold World just isn't there yet.

Also, I've made a lot of changes, and doubt I could adequately test
them in just a couple of weeks.

I've finished implementing the numeric dbrefs and string-&gt;dbref
translation layer, but haven't tested it yet.
