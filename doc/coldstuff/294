You are afraid of somebody hacking out the time string, if it is in the
database instead of the server.  However, if they did do this you would know
when it happened anyhow, because up to n time strings would have a time stamp,
then they wouldn't; but it would still be noticeable.  Anyhow, hacking security
in ColdMUD is different than in MOO.  In MOO you must get a "wiz" bit.  In
coldmud you simply have to gain access to $sys (once you can write to sys you
can do anything).  If they have access to sys they can just turn _OFF_ the
logging feature all together, which means that the difference between stamping
times on it or not would make _NO_ difference.  I can understand the reason for
a timestamp in MOO, because the server will call the log for various different
things, but not in Cold, therefore there is no reason to even worry about it.
