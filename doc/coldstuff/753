&lt; Definitely the form:
&lt;         open
&lt;         read/write
&lt;         close  
&lt;         stat or exists/eof

If this is the case, would you like to see connection io go the same route,
where you have to ask for input on a connection?

I dont know if I would like this or not, perhaps have both mechanisms going..
(defined when you open the connection as intrusive/non-intrusive)

I would like to make both work the same, because if done right there really
shouldn't be a difference to the db...  (of course, intrusive files would
just mean that every iteration of the main loop it would read a block in
from the file)
