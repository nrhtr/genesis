&lt; &gt; The main reason is that for cleanliness I only think you should have one

&lt; Surely this could be done in-DB, thus leaving the door open to
&lt; the idea of services which can handle multiple connections.

I did consider that, but the question has to be asked: why?  Having two
means of doing the same would add confusion and complexity to a really
simple system.  It would require adding more functions to control the
connections at a higher level.  Objects really do not have much of an
overhead as it is...
