From: Lynx &lt;BRANDON@cc.usu.edu&gt;

Ok, I'm rehashing this _once_ more.  I would like to get a cohesive
understanding of what people would like all core's to be like, so I can
re-structure the Cold Dark to this setup.

Now:

                              $root
                  $user_db----' | `-----$sys

Ok, root is very basic, we all understand what that is, it should have little
or nothing on it, unless it is completely neccessary.  As for $user_db, I'm
figuring i'll change $person to $user and have $player_db be $user_db, unless
nobody likes it.                |
                            $has_help
                               /|\  `--$utilities

How is the help system going to be done? did anybody ever figure this out?  I'm
thinking of putting $has_help where it is for now, as most help schemes would
work quite well with it there.

           .------------------' | `------------------.
   $command_handling            |                $frob_class
          |  \           $verb_handling               |
  $connection \                 |                $lock_class

Here is where i'm getting lost on some topics.  $command_ is still around,
looks like it will be for good (so it should work fine where it is).  Verbs are
currently nebulous as everybody has different theories on how they could work,
until this is decided should we just have $verb_handling where it is?  $frob&amp;
$lock i'm totally in the dark with, so i'll throw them where Greg sez. 
$connection works great.
               \           $described
                \               |
                |           $physical
                |              / \-----$exit
                |         .---'   `---.
                |   $container       $located
                |----.  / \  `-----.   / \
                |   $room  `----+--|--' $thing
                                    `---. |
                                       $box
I beleive there was no problems with this, no?

                |`--------------|   
      $command_repository-----$user 
                                |
                           $character-----$guest
                            /      \
                     $builder    $automaton
                         / 
                  $programmer

ok, from here $command_repository is just that, it helps to keep code-systems
from all being on $user.  $user was $person.  $character was $player, i'll
probably move most methods etc to $user.  $character may also be $person...?

The rest is self explanatory...

Also, I dont recall: what happened to $event_handling and $receiver?
