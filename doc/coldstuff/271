&lt; However, here's another point:  If you want to add a new standard service
&lt; under Lynx's plan, you need to go through this whole process all over again
&lt; to pick a port number and get everybody to agree that that number will
&lt; represent that service forever and all time, and then hope that nothing you
&lt; don't know about is going to kill everything dead...

well, no...The idea is to define some basic system and then a few basic startup
ports with this system.  The one I posted was to use ports xxxn, where n
increments for different services (starting at 0 for login).

&lt; In my opinion, it is MUCH preferable to set up a system whereby services can
&lt; be looked up and accessed by name, rather than some arbitrary

That would be the portmapper service (xxx1).

All i'm requesting is to standardize a system (like the xxxn) and a few basic
ports, like xxx0 through xxx3 (login, portmapper, link, smtp)  I may have
forgotten one or two...
