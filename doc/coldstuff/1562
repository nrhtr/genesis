I need to write some code which will be used in 3 places whenever a request
is made to my server. It is to keep track of unique ips. I will likely
write it a few different methods and test for speed/memory usage, however I
would appreciate any suggestions that peopel have.

I am currently considdering taking the ip and turning it into a single
integer and using objects in the database as nodes in a binary tree.  I'm
not sure how much overhead will come with the use of all those objects.
I'm also think of using nested dictionaries and a list to store the ip's by
hierarchical numbering based on the four number fields. I know dictionaries
tend to be slow, and ColdC's non-mutable datatypes can be a pain, but I
dont know what is the lesser of the two evils.

Anywho, I'm off to write some code.. if someone can suggest something
better please do.
