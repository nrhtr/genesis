Sorry for the outage, our router's entire OS in flash ROM became 
corrupted, and I just now finally installed a non-corrupted version.  
Needless to say, cold.org is back online.

There is also a new release of the driver, fixing many problems/bugs/etc. 
I am not releasing a patch file because I believe it would be larger than
the tar (I made many changes, in order to get it closer to working in
Win32). 

The only db-impacting change to be concerned about is the arguments to 
$sys.signal() have changed, it now only receives one argument, which is a 
symbol for the signal (i.e. 'INT, or 'TERM).

However, you SHOULD read the CHANGES file and the README file, always.

Quick Notes on p8:

  * I suspect it will work on a DEC Alpha system, I will try later today
    on a Dec alpha with osf/1.
  * lots of bug fixes, including the critical expression bug fix
  * a few features you can enable in defs.h, read the CHANGES file.

It is available at: ftp://cold.org/cold/drivers/Genesis-1.0p8.tar.gz
