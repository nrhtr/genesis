D'oh

&gt; Will we be using the unix.dll that cygnus.com is getting together? I have 
&gt; done some winNT/95 work with it and it could be a good transfer zone to 
&gt; full win95.

I havn't heard about the unix.dll, so I can't say :)

Actually, i've been working with a friend of my who has done quite a bit 
of PC/DOS/Windows programming (joshua jensen).  Frankly there will not be 
much needed to change, to compile in windows 95.  A few things here and 
there, rewrite of file.c, and we are set.  Josh already has bison for 
win95 so I would believe we will be seeing a win95 version soon after 1.0 
is out.
