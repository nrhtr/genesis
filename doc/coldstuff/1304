Sorry, about my previous email.  There is no problem that involves the
Cold server.  Doesn't involved mudservices either.  It is a "staying
alive" issue, but it comes from Remedy and its router.  I should have
investigated this in greater detail before posting, but I thought it was
something that mudservices had done to correct its severe crashes that
also started to make cold misbehave.  The Remedy problem was masked
because my other mud connection was active enough to keep the connection
from dying.
