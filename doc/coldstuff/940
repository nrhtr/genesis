&gt; 
&gt; Since there is a POSIX standard for regular expressions, should we hook into
&gt; the system regular expressions if they exist, resorting to our own regexp 
&gt; code if it does not?
&gt; 
&gt; The problems which could arise with this is that the current POSIX 
&gt; standard seems to be somewhat vague, leaving openings for interpretation 
&gt; by implementors.  Basically, certain aspects of regular expressions could 
&gt; change depending on what OS the driver is running under.
&gt; 

I think we should use Perl regexp (if you feel like isolating its
source). At least I can tell which characters need to be backslashed and
when in Perl regexp. :) It's also somewhat standard and powerful
enough.
