&gt; Well, I decided to mess around a bit with the latest driver, so I

I'm hoping to have another ALPHA4 core available today--with @build and
company fixed.

&gt; Except:
&gt; It has one command, QUIT. Said command doesn't seem to work.

&gt; Really. I mean it. I type QUITE and it responds with Goodbye.

Erm, it should have said:

  &gt; QUIT
  Oops, `QUIT` is not supported here.  Try `@quit`
  Use `@help commands` for an explanation on the differences in commands.

There is an object in your command cache that knows a few of the
unsupported commands, and points you in the right direction (I opted to do
this rather than dirty up the actual command environment with lots of
different awkward non-standard (by my standards :) aliases)  Use the
command '@which QUIT' to see all of the places it shows up (@which does
not check command aliases, as they are from a different parser).

Typing QUITE does:

  I don't understand QUITE.

Do you have any command aliases?  One of those could be conflicting, try:

  @command-aliases|@ca

See what you have defined..
