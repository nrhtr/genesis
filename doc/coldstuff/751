The Cold Dark and ColdX mailing lists are temporarily munched, as the machine
is getting an upgrade.

Furthermore, the guy doing the upgrade forgot to backup the local directory,
which means those who were on the lists need to re-register again.

I will post here when they are online.

Until then, I have a question on functionality:

I am currently in the process of adding a higher level of file control to
the system.  Which of the following would you rather see:

read_file("filename", DBREF)

Where it opens file and reads blocks from it, sending them to DBREF until
the file is at it's end.

Or:

open_file("filename", DBREF)
  (opens the file, read's nothing)
read_file()
  (read's a block of the file associated with this object, returns it in
   buffer form)
close_file("filename", DBREF)

Furthermore, there will also be:

stat_file("filename")

which will return some basic information on the file (does it exist?  etc)

-Brandon

(Actually, close_file() would be in the first option too)
