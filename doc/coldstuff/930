Genesis 0.4 is the step right before 0.1; all of the bugs we
know of have been FOUND AND SQUASHED.  This even includes the
infamous objects-lost-during-textdumping!

Interested souls can use Genesis 0.4 as a pre Genesis 1.0.  There
will be no more syntax changes after this point; native methods
will be added in cooperation and supplementation with existing functions,
they will not replace any.

If anybody needs any help upgrading their database contact me.

And in other news; after the 1.0 version is released I will be working on 
getting a win32 version available to the masses; most of the work 
involved will simply be converting file handling functions accordingly.  
Basically; you will be able to run it in windows 95.

Enjoy!
