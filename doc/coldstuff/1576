&gt; How do people usually set up editing when they're doing a lot of
&gt; programming?  In Genesis, or other MOOs, doesn't matter.  I'm just looking
&gt; for good concepts.  I'm ready to start implementing editing in my core.

     MCP, or MOO Client Protocl, which Bruce alluded to is what most
serious MOO coders use - essentially it's a set of tags that tell the
browser to to filter output from the user's view of the session and
send it to a separate buffer for editing.  I believe it was first
developed for use with emacs mud.el, but as Bruce mentioned, tkMOO
supports it.  I'm sure you can find a web page somewhere about it.
There are a couple links to MOO clients that support MCP here:

http://dmoz.org/Games/Internet/MUDs/MOOs/MOO_Clients/

     Unfortunately, I'm about to leave work so Ican't do any more
legwork on this.  Hm, here's a general page on it, along with pointers
to the spec, the MCP-dev mailnig list, etc.
