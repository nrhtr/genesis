Just stumbled across a few more I would like to bounce off people:

  set_name()   =&gt; add_dbref()
  del_name()   =&gt; del_dbref()
  get_name()   =&gt; get_dbref()

I would like to have set_ go to add_ because you can have more than 1 dbref to
an object, so "setting" it is somewhat inaccurate.

(BTW, the reason I am doing this is not out of "preference" but because it
makes the server much more clear).

Oh, I am also working on rewriting the manual with these changes, and to make
it high end hypertext, which is why I'm suddenly bringing them up :b  (it isn't
finished yet, dont ask).
