Ok, how about having fetch_file() which works like echo_file() but it returns
it in strings, so you can manipulate it from there.

Now this next suggestion is getting almost into a security hole, but hey.  What
about creating a write_file() for gods, which has a builtin max of bytes that
they can write, modifyable only by the arch (programmer1)...  this would be
very hard to keep track of, but it would make it much easier for the other gods
to deal with disk based files, rather than having to create objects to hold all
the text.  Also with help, I would love to have a disk based help setup, where
$has_help simply echo's the files or whatever (so you dont have to load mongo
objects into mem every time somebody asks for help on something).

Anyhow.
