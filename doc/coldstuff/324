&gt; OK, where are the currently active Colds these days

Hmm.. maybe it's time for a FAQ? (can't hurt to start early, and a list of all
known ColdMUDs and their statuses might be nice to have available)..

I'm actually inclined to start pulling together some information for such a
beast now, while there isn't a whole lot to have to wade through..

Could people send me the name/status/address/administrator(s) of any known
ColdMUD sites (whether they're up or not, just as long as they are actually
planned to be down the line), and I'll put together a list?

While I'm at it, what sites (besides ftp.ccs.neu.edu) can the server be found
at, and does anybody know what's planned for the next few releases of the
server (I'm assuming there will be some)?

Any other info people can think of for a FAQ at this stage?

(People can send specific info to me personally.. discussions of what should be
on the FAQ etc should probably go to the maillist)
