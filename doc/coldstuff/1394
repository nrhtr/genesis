&gt; Did you run 'configure' btw? I'm curious.
&gt; 
&gt; If, in fact, you don't have a dbm library (look in /lib, /usr/lib, and
&gt; /usr/local/lib for *dbm*) then run out and fetch gdbm from your local GNU
&gt; software archive. Build and install it. Then make sure the Makefile includes
&gt; -lgdbm.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm fairly sure the configure script is supposed to take care of checking
&gt; this, but I could be wrong.

It does check for gdbm, but since every system varies in its dbm
implementation (at the time) I couldn't think of a simple way to determine
if there was a dbm implementation available.  I can think of one now, so
perhaps later versions will check that..
