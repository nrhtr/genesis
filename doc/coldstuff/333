I'd like to do it.  The best way I can see of doing it would be to have
run_script() return stdout of the script.  Then it would be a simple hack to
create a script that used 'spell' or whatever is on your system (or even hack a
nicer spell that execs the current spell, dunno).  Anyhow, right now I've
gotten to the point of:

     I can create a spell checking command from the shell.

     I can run it from coldmud, but cannot return the output.

Alternatives:

     I can run it from coldmud, and receive stdout
     I can run it via a faucet on another port, and have coldmud connect to it.
     I can always create another builtin.

I would personally prefer the first one, as it is the best, in my opinion, and
it also makes run_script a much more powerful builtin (from what you can do). 
Now, the problem comes up with how does run_script() return stdout?  I figure
just handle it like a connection and bind it to an object.  I.e.

    'run_script("script", ["args"], $object, &lt;background&gt;)'

Basically, handle it like a connection but have it run a script instead. 
Comments?

(Oh, also, I think that run_shell would be a better term no?)
