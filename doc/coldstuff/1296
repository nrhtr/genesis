<HR><H2>[COLD] Address Masking on list archives</H2>

I just hacked up the list archive gateway (www.cold.org/info/lists) so it
will mask any email addresses.  This is to reduce the likelyhood of
The address showing up in search engines and thus being a target for
Junk E-Mail.  Those who have expressed trepidation about showing up on
archives because of this reason can be a little less concerned.  If you
need the real address which has been masked, you can email me at
brandon@cold.org and I can try to get it for you.

Also.. there have been a few people who have their own archiving software
for these lists.  I would prefer this didn't happen because I don't know
if this archiving software will mask addresses or not.  If you need a
digest of older posts, I can provide them (I have them back to when
ColdMUD started).
