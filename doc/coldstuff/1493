buf_to_str is a single string covnersion.
buf_to_strings creates an array of strings based on a delimiter, as I recall.

As far as I know there has never been much of any documentation fo the native interface which, frankly,
is weak as hell.  I learned it frome xaminign the sourc code but ther are a LOT
of caveats (liek the agfct that yopu cant call back INTO the vm from outside.)

&gt;Oh, and I also added an Index for key terminology and all the functions.

&gt;  Subject: ColdC Reference Manual
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I'm just wrapping up my conversion of the ColdC Reference Manual into 
&gt;Word2k format (Word97 shares the same format).  I've added headings, 
&gt;footnotes where appropriate, cleaned up the spelling and grammar, tried 
&gt;to standardized usage of italics/bold and set the document up to be 
&gt;printed so that it could be then bound double-sided to save space/paper, 
&gt;etc. 
&gt;   
&gt;  I've run into three problems:
&gt;
&gt;  The missing section on Textdump Structure
&gt;  The missing section of Native Method Reference
&gt;  and unless I'm missing something, buf_to_str and buf_to_strings share 
&gt;the exact same description (which I believe, belongs to buf_to_strings)
&gt;
&gt;  I'm more than happy to share what I've completed with anyone 
&gt;interested, or even have the doc posted on the cold.org site if that's a 
&gt;reasonable thing to do.
