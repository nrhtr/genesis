&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess I'ld have to say I think its a bad ideas. I think its dilutes the

&gt;&gt;&gt; and FORCES yo uto learn how to write really good object orinted code.
&gt;&gt;But this isn't breaking the encapsulation--it is simply changing the
&gt;&gt;default value when a specific instance is not defined.  The variable still
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;instance in the ancestor tree)--and only change what you care about.
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like MOO's standard operation for decendants. Which I've 
&gt;really missed in ColdX. Variables default to the value defined above them 
&gt;in the public instance... I think the private, protected and public words 
&gt;sound strange when used in this respect, but I would find these features 
&gt;make more commonsense than the current system where you need to define 
&gt;values over and over again, which is bad programming in my mind.

Its handy.
What I do is inherit init routiens that do the same thing at obejct init,
so I dont feel strongly abotu it, now thatI understand it.
