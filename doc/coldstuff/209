Yes, I know this has been mailed out recently, but I just went nuts and
cleared out all the old mail in my mailbox today and lost it...
where can I find it?

Also, I had a question about the core.  I was looking back at my notes on
coolMUD and noticed that it's core was much simpler.  As in you had a root
object, then a described and located object, then under those two, thing,
room, exit, and player... Now I can see breaking one or two of those down
some, but is there a reason for having so many different parent objects in
the core?  Or is a lot of that just in there for the sake of having a little
of something for everyone.
