<HR><H2>oh, hey, more gratuitous driver changes.</H2>

I would like to change the filesystem end of how the driver functions
to something more standard (at least standard as far as the various
public services packages I've used (httpd/gopher/netrek (heh)).

Currently:

coldmud [world location] [args to be passed to $sys.startup()] &gt;&gt;&amp; logfile &amp;

Where you redirect stderr to a logfile, if you wish to log whatever.

What I would like to have:

coldmud [-r cold root] [args to be passed to $sys.startup()]

The way this would work is cold-root would have:

       src/
       bin/
       world/
             binary/
             text/
             src/
       logs/

logs/ would be where it writes an argv[0].log and an argv[0].pid (the .pid is
very handy).  bin/ would be where execute() would check for scripts.
world/src/ would be where the world core source is (this actually could be
called anything, and has no effect upon the driver).  text/ and binary/ are
the same as they are now.  The textdump would go in world/textdump.

The reason I would like to have it handle it's own logfiles, rather than
redirecting stderr is primarily out of personal preference (it feels cleaner
to have coldmud do it itself, and isn't much harder).

If -r coldroot is not specified in the arguments, it would default to "../". 
The way args would be handled is if they exist, and the first argument is -r,
the driver munges it and passes whatever is left.  If -r is not the first
arg the driver passes it all to the system object.
