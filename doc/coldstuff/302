   OK, I have returned to comment on this subject:

   Default ports are keen.  However, if someone wants to change that, they
   should be able to.  Of course, this brings up the problem of how to
   tell WHAT ports person_x is using.  For instance, I hate the idea of
   using 5550..that's such a boring port number.  For Phoenix, I would use
   something like 1717 or maybe some other derivation there-on.  (For the
   reasoning, you should remember that the culture of the theme places
   quite a bit of respect in the number 17).  Of course, this implies
   I would not want to connect to other MUDs, so it may not be important,
   And I could run the other services (finger, etc) on the standard ports.

   Tough to say.


Well, I dont think anything that has been suggested so far is intended
to be hard-coded, merely the suggested defaults, which will come with
the core. (correct me if I'm wrong guys). With the portswapper thing,
or a single multi-use port, you would still be able to use all of the
services on whichever ports, theoretically, using the standard ports
would be more convinient, as it could remove some code from inter-mud
processes. You could also theoretically have your services on the
standard ports, and put telnet on 1717, since thats what your going to
advertise anyway. :)
