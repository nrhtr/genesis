Well.. all this discussions about protocols leads me to a serious dilemn
about the way I would implement my ColdC mode in the OO-Browser of
(X)Emacs.
	Just little word about the project I run: I try to implement a
mainly completely new core in ColdC. Completely? Not, just very different. 
More a Core for administration by no programmer. But that's not the
question.  The question is that I need to browse the big Core of objects
to more understand ColdCore and trying to not reinventing the wheel.
That's why I'm trying to implement ColdC support in the OO-Browser.

For the moment, the project goes well (I really think to release a first
version of the coldc-mode for january) but I want to go further. For the
moment I only implement it for the textdump and .cdc file format.
But it will be really cool if I can browse and edit an running-up DB. I
can I do that. Logging in as regular user can be disturbing because you
have to do it lot of time but can stay here because you aren't here (or
there are some who can mud/chat and browse big hierarchy all at the same
time?). Using a specialized guest aren't enough too because we need some
time special permissions to mojo some verbs etc... OO-Browsing are really
for big maintenance work!

Then what now? My solution was to use a daemon. Which one? I don't know.
The gateway interface are cool but can I pass safely a user name and
password under http? I don't think so (but may be isn't safe too with
telnet). Also, http needs really lot of parsing to extract the
information correctly. Than telnet? ftp? smtp? a completely new protocol?

What's your idea about this? I will promote the most useful suggestion,
especially if someone says me s/he wants to implement the same support to
another programming tool... 

Thanks and sorry for the long mail :-/
