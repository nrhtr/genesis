Hi all.  I'd like to learn more about ColdMUD. I've been looking
at the docs and it seems like a really excellent server. But I can't
seem to find the "on" switch.

Looks like I'm going to need a "core" of some kind, and the coldmud
package doesn't give any information on where to get one. I downloaded
a copy of TheColdDark, and it runs, but I'm only able to log in as a guest,
and the help seems to be broken :)

Anyway, I don't mind starting from scratch if need be, but there are no
instructions on how to start clean, with an empty database, or even how to 
write a minimal db.

If anyone can help, please send mail. Thank you.
