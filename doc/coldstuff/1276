<HR><H2>[COLD] Not an ad for vworlds-biz</H2>

This is not an ad for vworlds-biz but it is
a solicitation for Black Rabbit.  I know that
a couple of people are Cold-knowledgeable and
are also on the vworlds-biz mail list.

I have the server running at blackrabbit.mudservices.com 1138
and need an admin or two and even some programmers to help make
some interesting things for the vworlds-biz mail list guests and
for possibly some other visitors.

Although I picked the Oz Tower theme, you can remodel anyway
you please (elevators would be nice).  I'm also open to
having Pueblo-enhancements or anthing else that would
make the place interesting.

You don't need to worry about the game section.  I'll worry about
that (although probably nothing will get done with it either).
But if you are interested in working on the game section the
theme is futuristic and hard-hitting.  For example I'd like
to see a mud version of PMS (see this month's Wired for an
article about some kick-butt Quake women.).

Log in &amp; hang out. Let me know what you plans are.
