I'm writing combat-mode code right now in c-- (or ColdC as Brandon
suggests it be called.) Anyway, if someone is part of a combat I need to
querey him each segment to find out if he wants to do anything (combat 
is sequentail, based on the Hero System.) Anyway I need to querey the 
character, but don't want the whole combat to hang if someone for some 
reasin can't or doesnt want to repsond.

What i need is a way to time out the attempt to get info from the user.

I realize that usually cold-mud code is driven by the user input, not the 
other way around.

Can someone tell me how to get th effect I'm after???

Thanks
