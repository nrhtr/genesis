&gt; 
&gt; Hokay, I tried the macho route and quickly caved in to reveal the
&gt; whimpering code-craven that I truly am.  Has anybody gone this route
&gt; and figured out The Answers to installing Cold on BSDI?  

I've only ever tried SunOS and Linux. I was gonna try Irix but the machine
 I was gonna try it on didn't have bison.

&gt; I made all of the recommended edits for BSD 4.3 and SunOS, but I get
&gt; the following results when I run the make.  Is this a flaw in the BSDI
&gt; include files, or is Cold neglecting to include a proper file for
&gt; BSDI?
&gt; 
&gt; (Yes, yes, I know, it's not Cold's fault, BSDI is breaking some sort
&gt; of rule and it's not posix-complaint or whatever, but that still
&gt; leaves me between a rock and a hard place).
&gt; 
&gt; Anxiously awaiting your insight...
&gt;                                    Puff

&gt; *** Error code 1
&gt; 
&gt; Stop.
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 

Syntax errors suggest something more fundamental to me. I usualy get warnings
 about pointers and things when I make under SunOS, but this looks way
 different.

The only error I know anything about is the implicit declaration of bcmp. This
 (as you will no doubt recall) is the function used in place of memcmp for
 SunOS. I don't know much about BSD or SunOS, much less BSDI, but if you know
 of a system routine which behaves the way memcmp is supposed to, use it
 instead. If you know where it's declared, include that.

I doubt that I'm telling you anythign you hadn't thought of, but I'm often
 surprised at what people don't know. :)

Incidentally, while the README recomends replaceing memcopy calls, I recomend
 just using bcopy and swapping the from and too args.
